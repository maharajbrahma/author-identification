SALOMÉ



[_Rising._] Will you indeed give me whatsoever I shall ask,

Tetrarch?



HERODIAS



Do not dance, my daughter.



HEROD



Everything, even the half of my kingdom.



SALOMÉ



You swear it, Tetrarch?



HEROD



I swear it, Salomé.



HERODIAS



Do not dance, my daughter.



SALOMÉ



By what will you swear, Tetrarch?



HEROD



By my life, by my crown, by my gods. Whatsoever you desire I will

give it you, even to the half of my kingdom, if you will but

dance for me. O, Salomé, Salomé, dance for me!



SALOMÉ



You have sworn, Tetrarch.



HEROD



I have sworn, Salomé.



SALOMÉ



All this I ask, even the half of your kingdom.



HERODIAS



My daughter, do not dance.



HEROD



Even to the half of my kingdom. Thou wilt be passing fair as a

queen, Salomé, if it please thee to ask for the half of my

kingdom. Will she not be fair as a queen? Ah! it is cold here!

There is an icy wind, and I hear ... wherefore do I hear in the

air this beating of wings? Ah! one might fancy a bird, a huge

black bird that hovers over the terrace. Why can I not see it,

this bird? The beat of its wings is terrible. The breath of the

wind of its wings is terrible. It is a chill wind. Nay, but it is

not cold, it is hot. I am choking. Pour water on my hands. Give

me snow to eat. Loosen my mantle. Quick! quick! loosen my mantle.

Nay, but leave it. It is my garland that hurts me, my garland of

roses. The flowers are like fire. They have burned my forehead.

[_He tears the wreath from his head and throws it on the table._]

Ah! I can breathe now. How red those petals are! They are like

stains of blood on the cloth. That does not matter. You must not

find symbols in everything you see. It makes life impossible. It

were better to say that stains of blood are as lovely as rose

petals. It were better far to say that.... But we will not speak

of this. Now I am happy, I am passing happy. Have I not the

right to be happy? Your daughter is going to dance for me. Will

you not dance for me, Salomé? You have promised to dance for me.

I will not have her dance.



SALOMÉ



I will dance for you, Tetrarch.



HEROD



You hear what your daughter says. She is going to dance for me.

You do well to dance for me, Salomé. And when you have danced for

me, forget not to ask of me whatsoever you wish. Whatsoever you

wish I will give it you, even to the half of my kingdom. I have

sworn it, have I not?



SALOMÉ



You have sworn it, Tetrarch.



HEROD
