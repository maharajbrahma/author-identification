THE VOICE OF JOKANAAN



Ah! the wanton! The harlot! Ah! the daughter of Babylon with her

golden eyes and her gilded eyelids!--Thus saith the Lord God, Let

there come up against her a multitude of men. Let the people take

stones and stone her....



HERODIAS



Command him to be silent.



THE VOICE OF JOKANAAN



Let the war captains pierce her with their swords, let them crush

her beneath their shields.



HERODIAS



Nay, but it is infamous.



THE VOICE OF JOKANAAN



It is thus that I will wipe out all wickedness from the earth,

and that all women shall learn not to imitate her abominations.



HERODIAS



You hear what he says against me? You allow him to revile your

wife?



HEROD



He did not speak your name.



HERODIAS



What does that matter? You know well that it is I whom he seeks

to revile. And I am your wife, am I not?



HEROD



Of a truth, dear and noble Herodias, you are my wife, and before

that you were the wife of my brother.



HERODIAS



It was you who tore me from his arms.



HEROD



Of a truth I was stronger.... But let us not talk of that matter.

I do not desire to talk of it. It is the cause of the terrible

words that the prophet has spoken. Peradventure on account of it

a misfortune will come. Let us not speak of this matter. Noble

Herodias, we are not mindful of our guests. Fill thou my cup, my

well-beloved. Fill with wine the great goblets of silver, and the

great goblets of glass. I will drink to Cæsar. There are Romans

here, we must drink to Cæsar.



ALL



Cæsar! Cæsar!



HEROD



Do you not see your daughter, how pale she is?



HERODIAS



What is it to you if she be pale or not?



HEROD



Never have I seen her so pale.



HERODIAS



You must not look at her.



THE VOICE OF JOKANAAN



In that day the sun shall become black like sackcloth of hair,

and the moon shall become like blood, and the stars of the

heavens shall fall upon the earth like ripe figs that fall from

the fig-tree, and the kings of the earth shall be afraid.



HERODIAS



Ah! Ah! I should like to see that day of which he speaks, when

the moon shall become like blood, and when the stars shall fall

upon the earth like ripe figs. This prophet talks like a drunken

man ... but I cannot suffer the sound of his voice. I hate his

voice. Command him to be silent.



HEROD



I will not. I cannot understand what it is that he saith, but it

may be an omen.



HERODIAS



I do not believe in omens. He speaks like a drunken man.



HEROD



It may be he is drunk with the wine of God.



HERODIAS



What wine is that, the wine of God? From what vineyards is it

gathered? In what wine-press may one find it?



HEROD



[_From this point he looks all the while at Salomé._]



Tigellinus, when you were at Rome of late, did the Emperor speak

with you: on the subject of...?



TIGELLINUS



On what subject, sire?



HEROD



On what subject? Ah! I asked you a question, did I not? I have

forgotten what I would have asked you.



HERODIAS



You are looking again at my daughter. You must not look at her. I

have already said so.



HEROD



You say nothing else.



HERODIAS



I say it again.



HEROD



And that restoration of the Temple about which they have talked

so much, will anything be done? They say the veil of the

Sanctuary has disappeared, do they not?



HERODIAS



It was thyself didst steal it. Thou speakest at random. I will

not stay here. Let us go within.



HEROD



Dance for me, Salomé.



HERODIAS



I will not have her dance.



SALOMÉ



I have no desire to dance, Tetrarch.



HEROD



Salomé, daughter of Herodias, dance for me.



HERODIAS



Let her alone.



HEROD



I command thee to dance, Salomé.



SALOMÉ



I will not dance, Tetrarch.



HERODIAS



[_Laughing_].



You see how she obeys you.



HEROD



What is it to me whether she dance or not? It is naught to me.

To-night I am happy, I am exceeding happy. Never have I been so

happy.



FIRST SOLDIER



The Tetrarch has a sombre look. Has he not a sombre look?



SECOND SOLDIER



Yes, he has a sombre look.



HEROD



Wherefore should I not be happy? Cæsar, who is lord of the world,

who is lord of all things, loves me well. He has just sent me

most precious gifts. Also he has promised me to summon to Rome

the King of Cappadocia, who is my enemy. It may be that at Rome

he will crucify him, for he is able to do all things that he

wishes. Verily, Cæsar is lord. Thus you see I have a right to be

happy. Indeed, I am happy. I have never been so happy. There is

nothing in the world that can mar my happiness.



THE VOICE OF JOKANAAN



He shall be seated on this throne. He shall be clothed in scarlet

and purple. In his hand he shall bear a golden cup full of his

blasphemies. And the angel of the Lord shall smite him. He shall

be eaten of worms.



HERODIAS



You hear what he says about you. He says that you will be eaten

of worms.



HEROD



It is not of me that he speaks. He speaks never against me. It is

of the King of Cappadocia that he speaks; the King of Cappadocia,

who is mine enemy. It is he who shall be eaten of worms. It is

not I. Never has he spoken word against me, this prophet, save

that I sinned in taking to wife the wife of my brother. It may be

he is right. For, of a truth, you are sterile.



HERODIAS



I am sterile, I? You say that, you that are ever looking at my

daughter, you that would have her dance for your pleasure? It is

absurd to say that. I have borne a child. You have gotten no

child, no, not even from one of your slaves. It is you who are

sterile, not I.



HEROD



Peace, woman! I say that you are sterile. You have borne me no

child, and the prophet says that our marriage is not a true

marriage. He says that it is an incestuous marriage, a marriage

that will bring evils.... I fear he is right; I am sure that he

is right. But it is not the moment to speak of such things. I

would be happy at this moment. Of a truth, I am happy. There is

nothing I lack.



HERODIAS



I am glad you are of so fair a humour to-night. It is not your

custom. But it is late. Let us go within. Do not forget that we

hunt at sunrise. All honours must be shown to Cæsar's

ambassadors, must they not?



SECOND SOLDIER



What a sombre look the Tetrarch wears.



FIRST SOLDIER



Yes, he wears a sombre look.



HEROD



Salomé, Salomé, dance for me. I pray thee dance for me. I am sad

to-night. Yes; I am passing sad to-night. When I came hither I

slipped in blood, which is an evil omen; and I heard, I am sure I

heard in the air a beating of wings, a beating of giant wings. I

cannot tell what they mean ... I am sad to-night. Therefore dance

for me. Dance for me, Salomé, I beseech you. If you dance for me

you may ask of me what you will, and I will give it you, even

unto the half of my kingdom.
