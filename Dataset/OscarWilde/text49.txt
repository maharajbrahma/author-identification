               With the pirouettes of marionettes,

                 They tripped on pointed tread:

               But with flutes of Fear they filled the ear,

                 As their grisly masque they led,

               And loud they sang, and long they sang,

                 For they sang to wake the dead.



               "Oho!" they cried, "the world is wide,

                 But fettered limbs go lame!

               And once, or twice, to throw the dice

                 Is a gentlemanly game,

               But he does not win who plays with Sin

                 In the secret House of Shame."



               No things of air these antics were,

                 That frolicked with such glee:

               To men whose lives were held in gyves,

                 And whose feet might not go free,

               Ah! wounds of Christ! they were living things,

                 Most terrible to see.



               Around, around, they waltzed and wound;

                 Some wheeled in smirking pairs;

               With the mincing step of a demirep

                 Some sidled up the stairs:

               And with subtle sneer, and fawning leer,

                 Each helped us at our prayers.



               The morning wind began to moan,

                 But still the night went on:

               Through its giant loom the web of gloom

                 Crept till each thread was spun:

               And, as we prayed, we grew afraid

                 Of the Justice of the Sun.



               The moaning wind went wandering round

                 The weeping prison wall:

               Till like a wheel of turning steel

                 We felt the minutes crawl:

               O moaning wind! what had we done

                 To have such a seneschal?



               At last I saw the shadowed bars,

                 Like a lattice wrought in lead,

               Move right across the whitewashed wall

                 That faced my three-plank bed,

               And I knew that somewhere in the world

                 God's dreadful dawn was red.



               At six o'clock we cleaned our cells,

                 At seven all was still,

               But the sough and swing of a mighty wing

                 The prison seemed to fill,

               For the Lord of Death with icy breath

                 Had entered in to kill.



               He did not pass in purple pomp,

                 Nor ride a moon-white steed.

               Three yards of cord and a sliding board

                 Are all the gallows' need:

               So with rope of shame the Herald came

                 To do the secret deed.



               We were as men who through a fen

                 Of filthy darkness grope:

               We did not dare to breathe a prayer,

                 Or to give our anguish scope:

               Something was dead in each of us,

                 And what was dead was Hope.



               For Man's grim Justice goes its way

                 And will not swerve aside:

               It slays the weak, it slays the strong,

                 It has a deadly stride:

               With iron heel it slays the strong

                 The monstrous parricide!



               We waited for the stroke of eight:

                 Each tongue was thick with thirst:

               For the stroke of eight is the stroke of Fate

                 That makes a man accursed,

               And Fate will use a running noose

                 For the best man and the worst.



               We had no other thing to do,

                 Save to wait for the sign to come:

               So, like things of stone in a valley lone,

                 Quiet we sat and dumb:

               But each man's heart beat thick and quick,

                 Like a madman on a drum!



               With sudden shock the prison-clock

                 Smote on the shivering air,

               And from all the gaol rose up a wail

                 Of impotent despair,

               Like the sound the frightened marshes hear

                 From some leper in his lair.



               And as one sees most fearful things

                 In the crystal of a dream,

               We saw the greasy hempen rope

                 Hooked to the blackened beam,

               And heard the prayer the hangman's snare

                 Strangled into a scream.



               And all the woe that moved him so

                 That he gave that bitter cry,

               And the wild regrets, and the bloody sweats,

                 None knew so well as I:

               For he who lives more lives than one

                 More deaths that one must die.

                                             There is no chapel on the day

                 On which they hang a man:

               The Chaplain's heart is far too sick,

                 Or his face is far too wan,

               Or there is that written in his eyes

                 Which none should look upon.



               So they kept us close till nigh on noon,

                 And then they rang the bell,

               And the warders with their jingling keys

                 Opened each listening cell,

               And down the iron stair we tramped,

                 Each from his separate Hell.
               Out into God's sweet air we went,

                 But not in wonted way,

               For this man's face was white with fear,

                 And that man's face was gray,

               And I never saw sad men who looked

                 So wistfully at the day.



               I never saw sad men who looked

                 With such a wistful eye

               Upon that little tent of blue

                 We prisoners called the sky,

               And at every happy cloud that passed

                 In such strange freedom by.



               But there were those amongst us all

                 Who walked with downcast head,

               And knew that, had each got his due,

                 They should have died instead:

               He had but killed a thing that lived,

                 Whilst they had killed the dead.



               For he who sins a second time

                 Wakes a dead soul to pain,

               And draws it from its spotted shroud

                 And makes it bleed again,

               And makes it bleed great gouts of blood,

                 And makes it bleed in vain!



               Like ape or clown, in monstrous garb

                 With crooked arrows starred,

               Silently we went round and round

                 The slippery asphalte yard;

               Silently we went round and round,

                 And no man spoke a word.



               Silently we went round and round,

                 And through each hollow mind

               The Memory of dreadful things
Rushed like a dreadful wind,

               And Horror stalked before each man,

                 And Terror crept behind.



               The warders strutted up and down,

                 And watched their herd of brutes,

               Their uniforms were spick and span,

                 And they wore their Sunday suits,

               But we knew the work they had been at,

                 By the quicklime on their boots.



               For where a grave had opened wide,

                 There was no grave at all:

               Only a stretch of mud and sand

                 By the hideous prison-wall,

               And a little heap of burning lime,

                 That the man should have his pall.



               For he has a pall, this wretched man,

                 Such as few men can claim:

               Deep down below a prison-yard,

                 Naked, for greater shame,

               He lies, with fetters on each foot,

                 Wrapt in a sheet of flame!



               And all the while the burning lime

                 Eats flesh and bone away,

               It eats the brittle bones by night,

                 And the soft flesh by day,

               It eats the flesh and bone by turns,

                 But it eats the heart alway.



               For three long years they will not sow

                 Or root or seedling there:

               For three long years the unblessed spot

                 Will sterile be and bare,

               And look upon the wondering sky

                 With unreproachful stare.
They think a murderer's heart would taint

                 Each simple seed they sow.

               It is not true! God's kindly earth

                 Is kindlier than men know,

               And the red rose would but glow more red,

                 The white rose whiter blow.



               Out of his mouth a red, red rose!

                 Out of his heart a white!

               For who can say by what strange way,

                 Christ brings His will to light,

               Since the barren staff the pilgrim bore

                 Bloomed in the great Pope's sight?
