SCENE.--_A great terrace in the Palace of Herod, set above the

banqueting-hall. Some soldiers are leaning over the balcony. To

the right there is a gigantic staircase, to the left, at the

back, an old cistern surrounded by a wall of green bronze.

Moonlight._



THE YOUNG SYRIAN



How beautiful is the Princess Salomé to-night!



THE PAGE OF HERODIAS



Look at the moon! How strange the moon seems! She is like a woman

rising from a tomb. She is like a dead woman. You would fancy she

was looking for dead things.



THE YOUNG SYRIAN



She has a strange look. She is like a little princess who wears a

yellow veil, and whose feet are of silver. She is like a princess

who has little white doves for feet. You would fancy she was

dancing.



THE PAGE OF HERODIAS



She is like a woman who is dead. She moves very slowly.



[_Noise in the banqueting-hall._]



FIRST SOLDIER



What an uproar! Who are those wild beasts howling?



SECOND SOLDIER



The Jews. They are always like that. They are disputing about

their religion.



FIRST SOLDIER



Why do they dispute about their religion?



SECOND SOLDIER



I cannot tell. They are always doing it. The Pharisees, for

instance, say that there are angels, and the Sadducees declare

that angels do not exist.



FIRST SOLDIER



I think it is ridiculous to dispute about such things.



THE YOUNG SYRIAN



How beautiful is the Princess Salomé to-night!



THE PAGE OF HERODIAS



You are always looking at her. You look at her too much. It is

dangerous to look at people in such fashion. Something terrible

may happen.THE YOUNG SYRIAN



She is very beautiful to-night.



FIRST SOLDIER



The Tetrarch has a sombre look.



SECOND SOLDIER



Yes; he has a sombre look.



FIRST SOLDIER



He is looking at something.



SECOND SOLDIER



He is looking at some one.



FIRST SOLDIER



At whom is he looking?



SECOND SOLDIER



I cannot tell.



THE YOUNG SYRIAN



How pale the Princess is! Never have I seen her so pale. She is

like the shadow of a white rose in a mirror of silver.



THE PAGE OF HERODIAS



You must not look at her. You look too much at her.



FIRST SOLDIER



Herodias has filled the cup of the Tetrarch.



THE CAPPADOCIAN



Is that the Queen Herodias, she who wears a black mitre sewn with

pearls, and whose hair is powdered with blue dust?



FIRST SOLDIER



Yes; that is Herodias, the Tetrarch's wife.



SECOND SOLDIER



The Tetrarch is very fond of wine. He has wine of three sorts.

One which is brought from the Island of Samothrace, and is purple

like the cloak of Cæsar.



THE CAPPADOCIAN



I have never seen Cæsar.



SECOND SOLDIER



Another that comes from a town called Cyprus, and is yellow like

gold.



THE CAPPADOCIAN



I love gold.



SECOND SOLDIER



And the third is a wine of Sicily. That wine is red like blood.



THE NUBIAN



The gods of my country are very fond of blood. Twice in the year

we sacrifice to them young men and maidens; fifty young men and

a hundred maidens. But it seems we never give them quite enough,

for they are very harsh to us.



THE CAPPADOCIAN



In my country there are no gods left. The Romans have driven them

out. There are some who say that they have hidden themselves in

the mountains, but I do not believe it. Three nights I have been

on the mountains seeking them everywhere. I did not find them.

And at last I called them by their names, and they did not come.

I think they are dead.



FIRST SOLDIER



The Jews worship a God that you cannot see.



THE CAPPADOCIAN



I cannot understand that.



FIRST SOLDIER



In fact, they only believe in things that you cannot see.



THE CAPPADOCIAN



That seems to me altogether ridiculous.



THE VOICE OF JOKANAAN



After me shall come another mightier than I. I am not worthy so

much as to unloose the latchet of his shoes. When he cometh, the

solitary places shall be glad. They shall blossom like the lily.

The eyes of the blind shall see the day, and the ears of the deaf

shall be opened. The new-born child shall put his hand upon the

dragon's lair, he shall lead the lions by their manes.



SECOND SOLDIER



Make him be silent. He is always saying ridiculous things.



FIRST SOLDIER



No, no. He is a holy man. He is very gentle, too. Every day, when

I give him to eat he thanks me.



THE CAPPADOCIAN



Who is he?



FIRST SOLDIER



A prophet.



THE CAPPADOCIAN



What is his name?



FIRST SOLDIER



Jokanaan.



THE CAPPADOCIAN



Whence comes he?



FIRST SOLDIER



From the desert, where he fed on locusts and wild honey. He was

clothed in camel's hair, and round his loins he had a leathern

belt. He was very terrible to look upon. A great multitude used

to follow him. He even had disciples.



THE CAPPADOCIAN



What is he talking of?



FIRST SOLDIER



We can never tell. Sometimes he says terrible things, but it is

impossible to understand what he says.



THE CAPPADOCIAN



May one see him?



FIRST SOLDIER



No. The Tetrarch has forbidden it.



THE YOUNG SYRIAN



The Princess has hidden her face behind her fan! Her little white

hands are fluttering like doves that fly to their dove-cots. They

are like white butterflies. They are just like white butterflies.



THE PAGE OF HERODIAS



What is that to you? Why do you look at her? You must not look at

her.... Something terrible may happen.



THE CAPPADOCIAN



[_Pointing to the cistern._]



What a strange prison!



SECOND SOLDIER



It is an old cistern.



THE CAPPADOCIAN



An old cistern! It must be very unhealthy.



SECOND SOLDIER



Oh no! For instance, the Tetrarch's brother, his elder brother,

the first husband of Herodias the Queen, was imprisoned there for

twelve years. It did not kill him. At the end of the twelve years

he had to be strangled.



THE CAPPADOCIAN



Strangled? Who dared to do that?



SECOND SOLDIER



[_Pointing to the Executioner, a huge Negro._]



That man yonder, Naaman.



THE CAPPADOCIAN



He was not afraid?



SECOND SOLDIER



Oh no! The Tetrarch sent him the ring.



THE CAPPADOCIAN



What ring?



[Illustration: THE BLACK CAPE]



SECOND SOLDIER



The death-ring. So he was not afraid.



THE CAPPADOCIAN



Yet it is a terrible thing to strangle a king.



FIRST SOLDIER



Why? Kings have but one neck, like other folk.



THE CAPPADOCIAN



I think it terrible.



THE YOUNG SYRIAN



The Princess rises! She is leaving the table! She looks very

troubled. Ah, she is coming this way. Yes, she is coming towards

us. How pale she is! Never have I seen her so pale.



THE PAGE OF HERODIAS



Do not look at her. I pray you not to look at her.



THE YOUNG SYRIAN



She is like a dove that has strayed.... She is like a narcissus

trembling in the wind.... She is like a silver flower.



[_Enter Salomé_.]



SALOMÉ



I will not stay. I cannot stay. Why does the Tetrarch look at me

all the while with his mole's eyes under his shaking eyelids? It

is strange that the husband of my mother looks at me like that.

I know not what it means. In truth, yes, I know it.



THE YOUNG SYRIAN



You have just left the feast, Princess?



SALOMÉ



How sweet the air is here! I can breathe here! Within there are

Jews from Jerusalem who are tearing each other in pieces over

their foolish ceremonies, and barbarians who drink and drink, and

spill their wine on the pavement, and Greeks from Smyrna with

painted eyes and painted cheeks, and frizzed hair curled in

twisted coils, and silent, subtle Egyptians, with long nails of

jade and russett cloaks, and Romans brutal and coarse, with their

uncouth jargon. Ah! how I loathe the Romans! They are rough and

common, and they give themselves the airs of noble lords.



THE YOUNG SYRIAN



Will you be seated, Princess?



THE PAGE OF HERODIAS



Why do you speak to her? Why do you look at her? Oh! something

terrible will happen.



SALOMÉ



How good to see the moon! She is like a little piece of money,

you would think she was a little silver flower. The moon is cold

and chaste. I am sure she is a virgin, she has a virgin's beauty.

Yes, she is a virgin. She has never defiled herself. She has

never abandoned herself to men, like the other goddesses.



THE VOICE OF JOKANAAN



The Lord hath come. The son of man hath come. The centaurs have

hidden themselves in the rivers, and the sirens have left the

rivers, and are lying beneath the leaves of the forest.



SALOMÉ



Who was that who cried out?



SECOND SOLDIER



The prophet, Princess.



SALOMÉ



Ah, the prophet! He of whom the Tetrarch is afraid?



SECOND SOLDIER



We know nothing of that, Princess. It was the prophet Jokanaan

who cried out.



THE YOUNG SYRIAN



Is it your pleasure that I bid them bring your litter, Princess?

The night is fair in the garden.



SALOMÉ



He says terrible things about my mother, does he not?



SECOND SOLDIER



We never understand what he says, Princess.



SALOMÉ



Yes; he says terrible things about her.



[_Enter a Slave_.]



THE SLAVE



Princess, the Tetrarch prays you to return to the feast.



SALOMÉ



I will not go back.



THE YOUNG SYRIAN



Pardon me, Princess, but if you do not return some misfortune may

happen.



SALOMÉ



Is he an old man, this prophet?



THE YOUNG SYRIAN



Princess, it were better to return. Suffer me to lead you in.



SALOMÉ



This prophet ... is he an old man?



FIRST SOLDIER



No, Princess, he is quite a young man.



SECOND SOLDIER



You cannot be sure. There are those who say he is Elias.



SALOMÉ



Who is Elias?



SECOND SOLDIER



A very ancient prophet of this country, Princess.



THE SLAVE



What answer may I give the Tetrarch from the Princess?



THE VOICE OF JOKANAAN



Rejoice not thou, land of Palestine, because the rod of him who

smote thee is broken. For from the seed of the serpent shall come

forth a basilisk, and that which is born of it shall devour the

birds.



SALOMÉ



What a strange voice! I would speak with him.



FIRST SOLDIER



I fear it is impossible, Princess. The Tetrarch does not wish any

one to speak with him. He has even forbidden the high priest to

speak with him.



SALOMÉ



I desire to speak with him.



FIRST SOLDIER



It is impossible, Princess.



SALOMÉ



I will speak with him.



THE YOUNG SYRIAN



Would it not be better to return to the banquet?



SALOMÉ



Bring forth this prophet.



                             [_Exit the slave._]



FIRST SOLDIER



We dare not, Princess.



SALOMÉ



[_Approaching the cistern and looking down into it._]



How black it is, down there! It must be terrible to be in so

black a pit! It is like a tomb.... [_To the soldiers._] Did you

not hear me? Bring out the prophet. I wish to see him.



SECOND SOLDIER



Princess, I beg you do not require this of us.



SALOMÉ



You keep me waiting!



FIRST SOLDIER



Princess, our lives belong to you, but we cannot do what you have

asked of us. And indeed, it is not of us that you should ask this

thing.



SALOMÉ



[_Looking at the young Syrian._]



Ah!



THE PAGE OF HERODIAS



Oh! what is going to happen? I am sure that some misfortune will

happen.



SALOMÉ



[_Going up to the young Syrian._]



You will do this tiling for me, will you not, Narraboth? You will

do this thing for me. I have always been kind to you. You will do

it for me. I would but look at this strange prophet. Men have

talked so much of him. Often have I heard the Tetrarch talk of

him. I think the Tetrarch is afraid of him. Are you, even you,

also afraid of him, Narraboth?



THE YOUNG SYRIAN



I fear him not, Princess; there is no man I fear. But the

Tetrarch has formally forbidden that any man should raise the

cover of this well.



SALOMÉ



You will do this thing for me, Narraboth, and to-morrow when I

pass in my litter beneath the gateway of the idol-sellers I will

let fall for you a little flower, a little green flower.



THE YOUNG SYRIAN



Princess, I cannot, I cannot.



SALOMÉ



[_Smiling_.]



You will do this thing for me, Narraboth. You know that you will

do this thing for me. And to-morrow when I pass in my litter by

the bridge of the idol-buyers, I will look at you through the

muslin veils, I will look at you, Narraboth, it may be I will

smile at you. Look at me, Narraboth, look at me. Ah! you know

that you will do what I ask of you. You know it well.... I know

that you will do this thing.



THE YOUNG SYRIAN
