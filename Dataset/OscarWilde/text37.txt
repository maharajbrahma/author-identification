LORD DARLINGTON.  [_Takes chair and goes across L.C._]  I am quite

miserable, Lady Windermere.  You must tell me what I did.  [_Sits down at

table L._]



LADY WINDERMERE.  Well, you kept paying me elaborate compliments the

whole evening.



LORD DARLINGTON.  [_Smiling_.]  Ah, nowadays we are all of us so hard up,

that the only pleasant things to pay _are_ compliments.  They’re the only

things we _can_ pay.



LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Shaking her head_.]  No, I am talking very seriously.

You mustn’t laugh, I am quite serious.  I don’t like compliments, and I

don’t see why a man should think he is pleasing a woman enormously when

he says to her a whole heap of things that he doesn’t mean.



LORD DARLINGTON.  Ah, but I did mean them.  [_Takes tea which she offers

him_.]



LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Gravely_.]  I hope not.  I should be sorry to have to

quarrel with you, Lord Darlington.  I like you very much, you know that.

But I shouldn’t like you at all if I thought you were what most other men

are.  Believe me, you are better than most other men, and I sometimes

think you pretend to be worse.



LORD DARLINGTON.  We all have our little vanities, Lady Windermere.



LADY WINDERMERE.  Why do you make that your special one?  [_Still seated

at table L._]



LORD DARLINGTON.  [_Still seated L.C._]  Oh, nowadays so many conceited

people go about Society pretending to be good, that I think it shows

rather a sweet and modest disposition to pretend to be bad.  Besides,

there is this to be said.  If you pretend to be good, the world takes you

very seriously.  If you pretend to be bad, it doesn’t.  Such is the

astounding stupidity of optimism.



LADY WINDERMERE.  Don’t you _want_ the world to take you
LADY WINDERMERE.  Don’t you _want_ the world to take you seriously then,

Lord Darlington?



LORD DARLINGTON.  No, not the world.  Who are the people the world takes

seriously?  All the dull people one can think of, from the Bishops down

to the bores.  I should like _you_ to take me very seriously, Lady

Windermere, _you_ more than any one else in life.



LADY WINDERMERE.  Why—why me?



LORD DARLINGTON.  [_After a slight hesitation_.]  Because I think we

might be great friends.  Let us be great friends.  You may want a friend

some day.



LADY WINDERMERE.  Why do you say that?



LORD DARLINGTON.  Oh!—we all want friends at times.



LADY WINDERMERE.  I think we’re very good friends already, Lord

Darlington.  We can always remain so as long as you don’t—



LORD DARLINGTON.  Don’t what?



LADY WINDERMERE.  Don’t spoil it by saying extravagant silly things to

me.  You think I am a Puritan, I suppose?  Well, I have something of the

Puritan in me.  I was brought up like that.  I am glad of it.  My mother

died when I was a mere child.  I lived always with Lady Julia, my

father’s elder sister, you know.  She was stern to me, but she taught me

what the world is forgetting, the difference that there is between what

is right and what is wrong.  _She_ allowed of no compromise.  _I_ allow

of none.



LORD DARLINGTON.  My dear Lady Windermere!



LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Leaning back on the sofa_.]  You look on me as being

behind the age.—Well, I am!  I should be sorry to be on the same level as

an age like this.



LORD DARLINGTON.  You think the age very bad?



LADY WINDERMERE.  Yes.  Nowadays people seem to look on life as
a

speculation.  It is not a speculation.  It is a sacrament.  Its ideal is

Love.  Its purification is sacrifice.



LORD DARLINGTON.  [_Smiling_.]  Oh, anything is better than being

sacrificed!



LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Leaning forward_.]  Don’t say that.



LORD DARLINGTON.  I do say it.  I feel it—I know it.



[_Enter_ PARKER _C._]



PARKER.  The men want to know if they are to put the carpets on the

terrace for to-night, my lady?



LADY WINDERMERE.  You don’t think it will rain, Lord Darlington, do you?



LORD DARLINGTON.  I won’t hear of its raining on your birthday!



LADY WINDERMERE.  Tell them to do it at once, Parker.



                                                      [_Exit_ PARKER _C._]



LORD DARLINGTON.  [_Still seated_.]  Do you think then—of course I am

only putting an imaginary instance—do you think that in the case of a

young married couple, say about two years married, if the husband

suddenly becomes the intimate friend of a woman of—well, more than

doubtful character—is always calling upon her, lunching with her, and

probably paying her bills—do you think that the wife should not console

herself?



LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Frowning_.]  Console herself?



LORD DARLINGTON.  Yes, I think she should—I think she has the right.



LADY WINDERMERE.  Because the husband is vile—should the wife be vile

also?



LORD DARLINGTON.  Vileness is a terrible word, Lady Windermere.



LADY WINDERMERE.  It is a terrible thing, Lord Darlington.



LORD DARLINGTON.  Do you know I am afraid that good people do a great

deal of harm in this world.  Certainly the greatest harm they do is that

they make badness of such extraordinary importance.  It is absurd to

divide people into good and bad.  People are either charming or tedious.

I take the side of the charming, and you, Lady Windermere, can’t help

belonging to them.



LADY WINDERMERE.  Now, Lord Darlington.  [_Rising and crossing R._,

_front of him_.]  Don’t stir, I am merely going to finish my flowers.

[_Goes to table R.C._]



LORD DARLINGTON.  [_Rising and moving chair_.]  And I must say I think

you are very hard on modern life, Lady Windermere.  Of course there is

much against it, I admit.  Most women, for instance, nowadays, are rather

mercenary.



LADY WINDERMERE.  Don’t talk about such people.



LORD DARLINGTON.  Well then, setting aside mercenary people, who, of

course, are dreadful, do you think seriously that women who have

committed what the world calls a fault should never be forgiven?



LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Standing at table_.]  I think they should never be

forgiven.



LORD DARLINGTON.  And men?  Do you think that there should be the same

laws for men as there are for women?



LADY WINDERMERE.  Certainly!



LORD DARLINGTON.  I think life too complex a thing to be settled by these

hard and fast rules.



LADY WINDERMERE.  If we had ‘these hard and fast rules,’ we should find

life much more simple.



LORD DARLINGTON.  You allow of no exceptions?



LADY WINDERMERE.  None!



LORD DARLINGTON.  Ah, what a fascinating Puritan you are, Lady

Windermere!



LADY WINDERMERE.  The adjective was unnecessary, Lord Darlington.



LORD DARLINGTON.  I couldn’t help it.  I can resist everything except

temptation.



LADY WINDERMERE.  You have the modern affectation of weakness.



LORD DARLINGTON.  [_Looking at her_.]  It’s only an affectation, Lady

Windermere.



[_Enter_ PARKER _C._]



PARKER.  The Duchess of Berwick and Lady Agatha Carlisle.



[_Enter the_ DUCHESS OF BERWICK and LADY AGATHA CARLISLE _C._]



                                                      [_Exit_ PARKER _C._]



DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  [_Coming down C._, _and shaking hands_.]  Dear

Margaret, I am so pleased to see you.  You remember Agatha, don’t you?

[_Crossing L.C._]  How do you do, Lord Darlington?  I won’t let you know

my daughter, you are far too wicked.



LORD DARLINGTON.  Don’t say that, Duchess.  As a wicked man I am a

complete failure.  Why, there are lots of people who say I have never

really done anything wrong in the whole course of my life.  Of course

they only say it behind my back.



DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  Isn’t he dreadful?  Agatha, this is Lord Darlington.

Mind you don’t believe a word he says.  [LORD DARLINGTON _crosses R.C._]

No, no tea, thank you, dear.  [_Crosses and sits on sofa_.]  We have just

had tea at Lady Markby’s.  Such bad tea, too.  It was quite undrinkable.

I wasn’t at all surprised.  Her own son-in-law supplies it.  Agatha is

looking forward so much to your ball to-night, dear Margaret.



LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Seated L.C._]  Oh, you mustn’t think it is going to

be a ball, Duchess.  It is only a dance in honour of my birthday.  A

small and early.



LORD DARLINGTON.  [_Standing L.C._]  Very small, very early, and very

select, Duchess.



DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  [_On sofa L._]  Of course it’s going to be select.

But we know _that_, dear Margaret, about _your_ house.  It is really one

of the few houses in London where I can take Agatha, and where I feel

perfectly secure about dear Berwick.  I don’t know what society is coming

to.  The most dreadful people seem to go everywhere.  They certainly come

to my parties—the men get quite furious if one doesn’t ask them.  Really,

some one should make a stand against it.



LADY WINDERMERE.  _I_ will, Duchess.  I will have no one in my house

about whom there is any scandal.



LORD DARLINGTON.  [_R.C._]  Oh, don’t say that, Lady Windermere.  I

should never be admitted!  [_Sitting_.]



DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  Oh, men don’t matter.  With women it is different.

We’re good.  Some of us are, at least.  But we are positively getting

elbowed into the corner.  Our husbands would really forget our existence

if we didn’t nag at them from time to time, just to remind them that we

have a perfect legal right to do so.



LORD DARLINGTON.  It’s a curious thing, Duchess, about the game of

marriage—a game, by the way, that is going out of fashion—the wives hold

all the honours, and invariably lose the odd trick.



DUCHESS OF BERWICK.   The odd trick?  Is that the husband, Lord

Darlington?



LORD DARLINGTON.  It would be rather a good name for the modern husband.



DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  Dear Lord Darlington, how thoroughly depraved you

are!



LADY WINDERMERE.  Lord Darlington is trivial.



LORD DARLINGTON.  Ah, don’t say that, Lady Windermere.



LADY WINDERMERE.  Why do you _talk_ so trivially about life, then?



LORD DARLINGTON.  Because I think that life is far too important a thing

ever to talk seriously about it.  [_Moves up C._]



DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  What does he mean?  Do, as a concession to my poor

wits, Lord Darlington, just explain to me what you really mean.



LORD DARLINGTON.  [_Coming down back of table_.]  I think I had better

not, Duchess.  Nowadays to be intelligible is to be found out.  Good-bye!

[_Shakes hands with_ DUCHESS.]  And now—[_goes up stage_] Lady

Windermere, good-bye.  I may come to-night, mayn’t I?  Do let me come.



LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Standing up stage with_ LORD DARLINGTON.]  Yes,

certainly.  But you are not to say foolish, insincere things to people.



LORD DARLINGTON.  [_Smiling_.]  Ah! you are beginning to reform me.  It

is a dangerous thing to reform any one, Lady Windermere.  [_Bows_, _and

exit C._]



DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  [_Who has risen_, _goes C._]  What a charming,

wicked creature!  I like him so much.  I’m quite delighted he’s gone!

How sweet you’re looking!  Where _do_ you get your gowns?  And now I must

tell you how sorry I am for you, dear Margaret.  [_Crosses to sofa and

sits with_ LADY WINDERMERE.]  Agatha, darling!



LADY AGATHA.  Yes, mamma.  [_Rises_.]



DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  Will you go and look over the photograph album that

I see there?



LADY AGATHA.  Yes, mamma.  [_Goes to table up L._]



DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  Dear girl!  She is so fond of photographs of

Switzerland.  Such a pure taste, I think.  But I really am so sorry for

you, Margaret.



LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Smiling_.]  Why, Duchess?



DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  Oh, on account of that horrid woman.  She dresses so

well, too, which makes it much worse, sets such a dreadful example.

Augustus—you know my disreputable brother—such a trial to us all—well,

Augustus is completely infatuated about her.  It is quite scandalous, for

she is absolutely inadmissible into society.  Many a woman has a past,

but I am told that she has at least a dozen, and that they all fit.



LADY WINDERMERE.  Whom are you talking about, Duchess?



DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  About Mrs. Erlynne.



LADY WINDERMERE.  Mrs. Erlynne?  I never heard of her, Duchess.  And what

_has_ she to do with me?



DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  My poor child!  Agatha, darling!



LADY AGATHA.  Yes, mamma.



DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  Will you go out on the terrace and look at the

sunset?



LADY AGATHA.  Yes, mamma.



                                             [_Exit through window_, _L._]



DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  Sweet girl!  So devoted to sunsets!  Shows such

refinement of feeling, does it not?  After all, there is nothing like

Nature, is there?



LADY WINDERMERE.  But what is it, Duchess?  Why do you talk to me about

this person?



DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  Don’t you really know?  I assure you we’re all so

distressed about it.  Only last night at dear Lady Jansen’s every one was

saying how extraordinary it was that, of all men in London, Windermere

should behave in such a way.



LADY WINDERMERE.  My husband—what has _he_ got to do with any woman of

that kind?



DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  Ah, what indeed, dear?  That is the point.  He goes

to see her continually, and stops for hours at a time, and while he is

there she is not at home to any one.  Not that many ladies call on her,

dear, but she has a great many disreputable men friends—my own brother

particularly, as I told you—and that is what makes it so dreadful about

Windermere.  We looked upon _him_ as being such a model husband, but I am

afraid there is no doubt about it.  My dear nieces—you know the Saville

girls, don’t you?—such nice domestic creatures—plain, dreadfully plain,

but so good—well, they’re always at the window doing fancy work, and

making ugly things for the poor, which I think so useful of them in these

dreadful socialistic days, and this terrible woman has taken a house in

Curzon Street, right opposite them—such a respectable street, too!  I

don’t know what we’re coming to!  And they tell me that Windermere goes

there four and five times a week—they _see_ him.  They can’t help it—and

although they never talk scandal, they—well, of course—they remark on it

to every one.  And the worst of it all is that I have been told that this

woman has got a great deal of money out of somebody, for it seems that

she came to London six months ago without anything at all to speak of,

and now she has this charming house in Mayfair, drives her ponies in the

Park every afternoon and all—well, all—since she has known poor dear

Windermere.



LADY WINDERMERE.  Oh, I can’t believe it!
