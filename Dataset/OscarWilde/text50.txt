               And all the while the burning lime

                 Eats flesh and bone away,

               It eats the brittle bones by night,

                 And the soft flesh by day,

               It eats the flesh and bone by turns,

                 But it eats the heart alway.



               For three long years they will not sow

                 Or root or seedling there:

               For three long years the unblessed spot

                 Will sterile be and bare,

               And look upon the wondering sky

                 With unreproachful stare.



               They think a murderer's heart would taint

                 Each simple seed they sow.

               It is not true! God's kindly earth

                 Is kindlier than men know,

               And the red rose would but glow morered,

                 The white rose whiter blow.



               Out of his mouth a red, red rose!

                 Out of his heart a white!

               For who can say by what strange way,

                 Christ brings His will to light,

               Since the barren staff the pilgrim bore

                 Bloomed in the great Pope's sight?



               But neither milk-white rose nor red

                 May bloom in prison air;

               The shard, the pebble, and the flint,

                 Are what they give us there:

               For flowers have been known to heal

                 A common man's despair.



               So never will wine-red rose or white,

                 Petal by petal, fall

               On that stretch of mud and sand that lies

                 By the hideous prison-wall,

               To tell the men who tramp the yard

                 That God's Son died for all.



               Yet though the hideous prison-wall

                 Still hems him round and round,

               And a spirit may not walk by night

                 That is with fetters bound,

               And a spirit may but weep that lies

                 In such unholy ground,



               He is at peace- this wretched man-

                 At peace, or will be soon:

               There is no thing to make him mad,

                 Nor does Terror walk at noon,

               For the lampless Earth in which he lies

                 Has neither Sun nor Moon.



               They hanged him as a beast is hanged:
A requiem that might have brought

                 Rest to his startled soul,

               But hurriedly they took him out,

                 And hid him in a hole.



               The warders stripped him of his clothes,

                 And gave him to the flies:

               They mocked the swollen purple throat,

                 And the stark and staring eyes:

               And with laughter loud they heaped the shroud

                 In which the convict lies.



               The Chaplain would not kneel to pray

                 By his dishonoured grave:

               Nor mark it with that blessed Cross

                 That Christ for sinners gave,

               Because the man was one of those

                 Whom Christ came down to save.



               Yet all is well; he has but passed

                 To  Life's appointed bourne:

               And alien tears will fill for him

                 Pity's long-broken urn,

               For his mourners be outcast men,

                 And outcasts always mourn.

                               V



               I know not whether Laws be right,

                 Or whether Laws be wrong;

               All that we know who lie in gaol

                 Is that the wall is strong;

               And that each day is like a year,

                 A year whose days are long.



               But this I know, that every Law

                 That men have made for Man,

               Since first Man took His brother's life,

                 And the sad world began,

               But straws the wheat and saves the chaff

                 With a most evil fan.



               This too I know- and wise it were

                 If each could know the same-

               That every prison that men build

                 Is built with bricks of shame,

               And bound with bars lest Christ should see

                 How men their brothers maim.



               With bars they blur the gracious moon,

                 And blind the goodly sun:

               And the do well to hide their Hell,

                 For in it things are done

               That Son of things nor son of Man

                 Ever should look upon!



               The vilest deeds like poison weeds

                 Bloom well in prison-air:

               It is only what is good in Man

                 That wastes and withers there:

               Pale Anguish keeps the heavy gate,

                 And the warder is Despair.



               For they starve the little frightened child

                 Till it weeps both night and day:

               And they scourge the weak, and flog the fool,

                 And gibe the old and gray,

               And some grow mad, and all grow bad,

                 And none a word may say.



               Each narrow cell in which we dwell

                 Is a foul and dark latrine,

               And the fetid breath of living Death

                 Chokes up each grated screen,

               And all, but Lust, is turned to dust

                 In Humanity's machine.



               The brackish water that we drink

                 Creeps with a loathsome slime,

               And the bitter bread they weigh in scales

                 Is full of chalk and lime,

               And Sleep will not lie down, but walks

                 Wild-eyed, and cries to Time.



               But though lean Hunger and green Thirst

                 Like asp with adder fight,

               We have little care of prison fare,

                 For what chills and kills outright

               Is that every stone one lifts by day

                 Becomes one's heart by night.



               With midnight always in one's heart,

                 And twilight in one's cell,

               We turn the crank, or tear the rope,

                 Each in his separate Hell,

               And the silence is more awful far

                 Than the sound of a brazen bell.



               And never a human voice comes near

                 To speak a gentle word:

               And the eye that watches through the door

                 Is pitiless and hard:

               And by all forgot, we rot and rot,

                 With soul and body marred.



               And thus we rust Life's iron chain

                 Degraded and alone:

               And some men curse, and some men weep,

                 And some men make no moan:

               But God's eternal Laws are kind

                 And break the heart of stone.



               And every human heart that breaks,

                 In prison-cell or yard,

               Is as that broken box that gave

                 Its treasure to the Lord,

               And filled the unclean leper's house

                 With the scent of costliest nard.



               Ah! happy they whose hearts can break

                 And peace of pardon win!

               How else may man make straight his plan

                 And cleanse his soul from Sin?

               How else but through a broken heart

                 May Lord Christ enter in?



               And he of the swollen purple throat,

                 And the stark and staring eyes,

               Waits for the holy hands that took

                 The Thief to Paradise;

               And a broken and a contrite heart

                 The Lord will not despise.



               The man in red who reads the Law

                 Gave him three weeks of life,

               Three little weeks in which to heal

                 His soul of his soul's strife,

               And cleanse from every blot of blood

                 The hand that held the knife.



               And with tears of blood he cleansed the hand,

                 The hand that held the steel:

               For only blood can wipe out blood,

                 And only tears can heal:

               And the crimson stain that was of Cain

                 Became Christ's snow-white seal.
               In Reading gaol by Reading town

                 There is a pit of shame,

               And in it lies a wretched man

                 Eaten by teeth of flame,

               In a burning winding-sheet he lies,

                 And his grave has got no name.



               And there, till Christ call forth the dead,

                 In silence let him lie:

               No need to waste the foolish tear,

                 Or heave the windy sigh:

               The man had killed the thing he loved,

                 And so he had to die.



               And all men kill the thing they love,

                 By all let this be heard,

               Some do it with a bitter look,

                 Some with a flattering word,

               The coward does it with a kiss,

                 The brave man with a sword!
