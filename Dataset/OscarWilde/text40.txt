[_Signing to the third soldier._]



Let the prophet come forth.... The Princess Salomé desires to see

him.



SALOMÉ



Ah!



THE PAGE OF HERODIAS



Oh! How strange the moon looks. You would think it was the hand

of a dead woman who is seeking to cover herself with a shroud.



THE YOUNG SYRIAN



She has a strange look! She is like a little princess, whose eyes

are eyes of amber. Through the clouds of muslin she is smiling

like a little princess.



[_The prophet comes out of the cistern. Salomé looks at him and

steps slowly back._]

JOKANAAN



Where is he whose cup of abominations is now full? Where is he,

who in a robe of silver shall one day die in the face of all the

people? Bid him come forth, that he may hear the voice of him who

hath cried in the waste places and in the houses of kings.



SALOMÉ



Of whom is he speaking?



THE YOUNG SYRIAN



You can never tell, Princess.



JOKANAAN



Where is she who having seen the images of men painted on the

walls, the images of the Chaldeans limned in colours, gave

herself up unto the lust of her eyes, and sent ambassadors into

Chaldea?



SALOMÉ



It is of my mother that he speaks.



THE YOUNG SYRIAN

THE YOUNG SYRIAN



Oh, no, Princess.



SALOMÉ



Yes; it is of my mother that he speaks.



JOKANAAN



Where is she who gave herself unto the Captains of Assyria, who

have baldricks on their loins, and tiaras of divers colours on

their heads? Where is she who hath given herself to the young men

of Egypt, who are clothed in fine linen and purple, whose shields

are of gold, whose helmets are of silver, whose bodies are

mighty? Bid her rise up from the bed of her abominations, from

the bed of her incestuousness, that she may hear the words of him

who prepareth the way of the Lord, that she may repent her of her

iniquities. Though she will never repent, but will stick fast in

her abominations; bid her come, for the fan of the Lord is in His

hand.



SALOMÉ



But he is terrible, he is terrible!



THE YOUNG SYRIAN



Do not stay here, Princess, I beseech you.



SALOMÉ



It is his eyes above all that are terrible. They are like black

holes burned by torches in a Tyrian tapestry. They are like black

caverns where dragons dwell. They are like the black caverns of

Egypt in which the dragons make their lairs. They are like black

lakes troubled by fantastic moons.... Do you think he will speak

again?



THE YOUNG SYRIAN

Do not stay here, Princess. I pray you do not stay here.



SALOMÉ



How wasted he is! He is like a thin ivory statue. He is like an

image of silver. I am sure he is chaste as the moon is. He is

like a moonbeam, like a shaft of silver. His flesh must be cool

like ivory. I would look closer at him.



THE YOUNG SYRIAN



No, no, Princess.



SALOMÉ



I must look at him closer.



THE YOUNG SYRIAN



Princess! Princess!



JOKANAAN



Who is this woman who is looking at me? I will not have her look

at me. Wherefore doth she look at me with her golden eyes, under

her gilded eyelids? I know not who she is. I do not wish to know

who she is. Bid her begone. It is not to her that I would speak.



SALOMÉ



I am Salomé, daughter of Herodias, Princess of Judæa.



JOKANAAN



Back! daughter of Babylon! Come not near the chosen of the Lord.

Thy mother hath filled the earth with the wine of her iniquities,

and the cry of her sins hath come up to the ears of God.



SALOMÉ



Speak again, Jokanaan. Thy voiceis wine to me.



THE YOUNG SYRIAN



Princess! Princess! Princess!



SALOMÉ



Speak again! Speak again, Jokanaan, and tell me what I must do.



JOKANAAN



Daughter of Sodom, come not near me! But cover thy face with a

veil, and scatter ashes upon thine head, and get thee to the

desert and seek out the Son of Man.



SALOMÉ



Who is he, the Son of Man? Is he as beautiful as thou art,

Jokanaan?



JOKANAAN



Get thee behind me! I hear in the palace the beating of the wings

of the angel of death.




Jokanaan!



JOKANAAN



Who speaketh?



SALOMÉ



Jokanaan, I am amorous of thy body! Thy body is white like the

lilies of a field that the mower hath never mowed. Thy body is

white like the snows that lie on the mountains, like the snows

that lie on the mountains of Judæa, and come down into the

valleys. The roses in the garden of the Queen of Arabia are not

so white as thy body. Neither the roses in the garden of the

Queen of Arabia, the perfumed garden of spices of the Queen of

Arabia, nor the feet of the dawn when they light on the leaves,

nor the breast of the moon when she lies on the breast of the

sea.... There is nothing in the world so white as thy body. Let

me touch thy body.



JOKANAAN



Back! daughter of Babylon! By woman came evil into the world.

Speak not to me. I will not listen to thee. I listen but to the

voice of the Lord God.



SALOMÉ



Thy body is hideous. It is like the body of a leper. It is like a

plastered wall where vipers have crawled; like a plastered wall

where the scorpions have made their nest. It is like a whitened

sepulchre full of loathsome things. It is horrible, thy body is

horrible. It is of thy hair that I am enamoured, Jokanaan. Thy

hair is like clusters of grapes, like the clusters of black

grapes that hang from the vine-trees of Edom in the land of the

Edomites. Thy hair is like the cedars of Lebanon, like the great

cedars of Lebanon that give their shade to the lions and to the

robbers who would hide themselves by day. The long black nights,

when the moon hides her face, when the stars are afraid, are not

so black. The silence that dwells in the forest is not so black.

There is nothing in the world so black as thy hair.... Let me

touch thy hair.



JOKANAAN



Back, daughter of Sodom! Touch me not. Profane not the temple of

the Lord God.



SALOMÉ



Thy hair is horrible. It is covered with mire and dust. It is

like a crown of thorns which they have placed on thy forehead. It

is like a knot of black serpents writhing round thy neck. I love

not thy hair.... It is thy mouth that I desire, Jokanaan. Thy

mouth is like a band of scarlet on a tower of ivory. It is like a

pomegranate cut with a knife of ivory. The pomegranate-flowers

that blossom in the gardens of Tyre, and are redder than roses,

are not so red. The red blasts of trumpets that herald the

approach of kings, and make afraid the enemy, are not so red.

Thy mouth is redder than the feet of those who tread the wine in

the wine-press. Thy mouth is redder than the feet of the doves

who haunt the temples and are fed by the priests. It is redder

than the feet of him who cometh from a forest where he hath slain

a lion, and seen gilded tigers. Thy mouth is like a branch of

coral that fishers have found in the twilight of the sea, the

coral that they keep for the kings!... It is like the vermilion

that the Moabites find in the mines of Moab, the vermilion that

the kings take from them. It is like the bow of the King of the

Persians, that is painted with vermilion, and is tipped with

coral. There is nothing in the world so red as thy mouth.... Let

me kiss thy mouth.



JOKANAAN



Never! daughter of Babylon! Daughter of Sodom! Never.



SALOMÉ



I will kiss thy mouth, Jokanaan. I will kiss thy mouth.



THE YOUNG SYRIAN



Princess, Princess, thou who art like a garden of myrrh, thou who

art the dove of all doves, look not at this man, look not at him!

Do not speak such words to him. I cannot suffer them....

Princess, Princess, do not speak these things.



SALOMÉ



I will kiss thy mouth, Jokanaan.



THE YOUNG SYRIAN



Ah! [_He kills himself and falls between Salomé and Jokanaan._]



THE PAGE OF HERODIAS



The young Syrian has slain himself! The young captain has slain

himself! He has slain himself who was my friend! I gave him a

little box of perfumes and ear-rings wrought in silver, and now

he has killed himself! Ah, did he not foretell that some

misfortune would happen? I, too, foretold it, and it has

happened. Well I knew that the moon was seeking a dead thing, but

I knew not that it was he whom she sought. Ah! why did I not hide

him from the moon? If I had hidden him in a cavern she would not

have seen him.



FIRST SOLDIER



Princess, the young captain has just killed himself.



SALOMÉ



Let me kiss thy mouth, Jokanaan.



JOKANAAN



Art thou not afraid, daughter of Herodias? Did I not tell thee

that I had heard in the palace the beatings of the wings of the

angel of death, and hath he not come, the angel of death?



[Illustration: ENTER HERODIAS]



SALOMÉ



Let me kiss thy mouth.



JOKANAAN



Daughter of adultery, there is but one who can save thee, it is

He of whom I spake. Go seek Him. He is in a boat on the sea of

Galilee, and He talketh with His disciples. Kneel down on the

shore of the sea, and call unto Him by His name. When He cometh

to thee (and to all who call on Him He cometh), bow thyself at

His feet and ask of Him the remission of thy sins.



SALOMÉ



Let me kiss thy mouth.



JOKANAAN



Cursed be thou! daughter of an incestuous mother, be thou

accursed!



SALOMÉ



I will kiss thy mouth, Jokanaan.



JOKANAAN



I do no wish to look at thee. I will not look at thee, thou art

accursed, Salomé, thou art accursed. [_He goes down into the

cistern._]



SALOMÉ



I will kiss thy mouth, Jokanaan; I will kiss thy mouth.



FIRST SOLDIER



We must bear away the body to another place. The Tetrarch does

not care to see dead bodies, save the bodies of those whom he

himself has slain.



THE PAGE OF HERODIAS



He was my brother, and nearer to me than a brother. I gave him a

little box full of perfumes, and a ring of agate that he wore

always on his hand. In the evening we used to walk by the river,

among the almond trees, and he would tell me of the things of his

country. He spake ever very low. The sound of his voice was like

the sound of the flute, of a flute player. Also he much loved to

gaze at himself in the river. I used to reproach him for that.



SECOND SOLDIER



You are right; we must hide the body. The Tetrarch must not see

it.



FIRST SOLDIER



The Tetrarch will not come to this place. He never comes on the

terrace. He is too much afraid of the prophet.



[_Enter Herod, Herodias, and all the Court._]



HEROD



Where is Salomé? Where is the Princess? Why did she not return to

the banquet as I commanded her? Ah! there she is!



HERODIAS



You must not look at her! You are always looking at her!



HEROD



The moon has a strange look to-night. Has she not a strange look?

She is like a mad woman, a mad woman who is seeking everywhere

for lovers. She is naked too. She is quite naked. The clouds are

seeking to clothe her nakedness, but she will not let them. She

shows herself naked in the sky. She reels through the clouds like

a drunken woman.... I am sure she is looking for lovers. Does she

not reel like a drunken woman? She is like a mad woman, is she

not?



HERODIAS



No; the moon is like the moon, that is all. Let us go within....

You have nothing to do here.



HEROD



I will stay here! Manesseh, lay carpets there. Light torches,

bring forth the ivory tables, and the tables of jasper. The air

here is delicious. I will drink more wine with my guests. We must

show all honours to the ambassadors of Cæsar.



HERODIAS



It is not because of them that you remain.



HEROD



Yes; the air is delicious. Come, Herodias, our guests await us.

Ah! I have slipped! I have slipped in blood! It is an ill omen.

It is a very evil omen. Wherefore is there blood here?... and

this body, what does this body here? Think you I am like the King

of Egypt, who gives no feast to his guests but that he shows them

a corpse? Whose is it? I will not look on it.



FIRST SOLDIER



It is our captain, sire. He is the young Syrian whom you made

captain only three days ago.



HEROD



I gave no order that he should be slain.



SECOND SOLDIER



He killed himself, sire.



HEROD



For what reason? I had made him captain.



SECOND SOLDIER



We do not know, sire. But he killed himself.



HEROD



That seems strange to me. I thought it was only the Roman

philosophers who killed themselves. Is it not true, Tigellinus,

that the philosophers at Rome kill themselves?



TIGELLINUS



There are some who kill themselves, sire. They are the Stoics.

The Stoics are coarse people. They are ridiculous people. I

myself regard them as being perfectly ridiculous.



HEROD



I also. It is ridiculous to kill oneself.



TIGELLINUS



Everybody at Rome laughs at them. The Emperor has written a

satire against them. It is recited everywhere.



HEROD



Ah! he has written a satire against them? Cæsar is wonderful. He

can do everything.... It is strange that the young Syrian has

killed himself. I am sorry he has killed himself. I am very

sorry; for he was fair to look upon. He was even very fair. He

had very languorous eyes. I remember that I saw that he looked

languorously at Salomé. Truly, I thought he looked too much at

her.



HERODIAS



There are others who look at her too much.



HEROD



His father was a king. I drove him from his kingdom. And you made

a slave of his mother, who was a queen, Herodias. So he was here

as my guest, as it were, and for that reason I made him my

captain. I am sorry he is dead. Ho! why have you left the body

here? I will not look at it--away with it! [_They take away the

body._] It is cold here. There is a wind blowing. Is there not a

wind blowing?



HERODIAS



No; there is no wind.



HEROD



I tell you there is a wind that blows.... And I hear in the air

something that is like the beating of wings, like the beating of

vast wings. Do you not hear it?



HERODIAS



I hear nothing.



HEROD



I hear it no longer. But I heard it. It was the blowing of the

wind, no doubt. It has passed away. But no, I hear it again. Do

you not hear it? It is just like the beating of wings.



HERODIAS



I tell you there is nothing. You are ill. Let us go within.



HEROD



I am not ill. It is your daughter who is sick. She has the mien

of a sick person. Never have I seen her so pale.



HERODIAS



I have told you not to look at her.



HEROD



Pour me forth wine [_wine is brought_]. Salomé, come drink a

little wine with me. I have here a wine that is exquisite. Cæsar

himself sent it me. Dip into it thy little red lips, that I may

drain the cup.



SALOMÉ



I am not thirsty, Tetrarch.



HEROD



You hear how she answers me, this daughter of yours?



HERODIAS



She does right. Why are you always gazing at her?



HEROD



Bring me ripe fruits [_fruits are brought_]. Salomé, come and eat

fruit with me. I love to see in a fruit the mark of thy little

teeth. Bite but a little of this fruit and then I will eat what

is left.



SALOMÉ



I am not hungry, Tetrarch.



HEROD



[_To Herodias._] You see how you have brought up this daughter of

yours.



HERODIAS



My daughter and I come of a royal race. As for thee, thy father

was a camel driver! He was also a robber!



HEROD



Thou liest!



HERODIAS



Thou knowest well that it is true.



HEROD



Salomé, come and sit next to me. I will give thee the throne of

thy mother.



SALOMÉ



I am not tired, Tetrarch.



HERODIAS



You see what she thinks of you.



HEROD



Bring me--what is it that I desire? I forget. Ah! ah! I remember.



[Illustration: THE EYES OF HEROD]



THE VOICE OF JOKANAAN



Lo! the time is come! That which I foretold has come to pass,

saith the Lord God. Lo! the day of which I spoke.



HERODIAS



Bid him be silent. I will not listen to his voice. This man is

for ever vomiting insults against me.



HEROD



He has said nothing against you. Besides, he is a very great

prophet.



HERODIAS



I do not believe in prophets. Can a man tell what will come to

pass? No man knows it. Moreover, he is for ever insulting me. But

I think you are afraid of him.... I know well that you are afraid

of him.



HEROD



I am not afraid of him. I am afraid of no man.



HERODIAS



I tell you, you are afraid of him. If you are not afraid of him

why do you not deliver him to the Jews, who for these six months

past have been clamouring for him?



A JEW



Truly, my lord, it were better to deliver him into our hands.



HEROD



Enough on this subject. I have already given you my answer. I

will not deliver him into your hands. He is a holy man. He is a

man who has seen God.



A JEW
