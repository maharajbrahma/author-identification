  _Lawn in front of the terrace at Hunstanton_.



[SIR JOHN _and_ LADY CAROLINE PONTEFRACT, MISS WORSLEY, _on chairs under

large yew tree_.]



LADY CAROLINE.  I believe this is the first English country house you

have stayed at, Miss Worsley?



HESTER.  Yes, Lady Caroline.



LADY CAROLINE.  You have no country houses, I am told, in America?



HESTER.  We have not many.



LADY CAROLINE.  Have you any country?  What we should call country?



HESTER.  [_Smiling_.]  We have the largest country in the world, Lady

Caroline.  They used to tell us at school that some of our states are as

big as France and England put together.



LADY CAROLINE.  Ah! you must find it very draughty, I should fancy.

[_To_ SIR JOHN.]  John, you should have your muffler.  What is the use of

my always knitting mufflers for you if you won’t wear them?



SIR JOHN.  I am quite warm, Caroline, I assure you.



LADY CAROLINE.  I think not, John.  Well, you couldn’t come to a more

charming place than this, Miss Worsley, though the house is excessively

damp, quite unpardonably damp, and dear Lady Hunstanton is sometimes a

little lax about the people she asks down here.  [_To_ SIR JOHN.]  Jane

mixes too much.  Lord Illingworth, of course, is a man of high

distinction.  It is a privilege to meet him.  And that member of

Parliament, Mr. Kettle—



SIR JOHN.  Kelvil, my love, Kelvil.



LADY CAROLINE.  He must be quite respectable.  One has never heard his

name before in the whole course of one’s life, which speaks volumes for a

man, nowadays.  But Mrs. Allonby is hardly a very suitable person.



HESTER.  I dislike Mrs. Allonby.  I dislike her more than I can say.



LADY CAROLINE.  I am not sure, Miss Worsley, that foreigners like

yourself should cultivate likes or dislikes about the people they are

invited to meet.  Mrs. Allonby is very well born.  She is a niece of Lord

Brancaster’s.  It is said, of course, that she ran away twice before she

was married.  But you know how unfair people often are.  I myself don’t

believe she ran away more than once.



HESTER.  Mr. Arbuthnot is very charming.



LADY CAROLINE.  Ah, yes! the young man who has a post in a bank.  Lady

Hunstanton is most kind in asking him here, and Lord Illingworth seems to

have taken quite a fancy to him.  I am not sure, however, that Jane is

right in taking him out of his position.  In my young days, Miss Worsley,

one never met any one in society who worked for their living.  It was not

considered the thing.



HESTER.  In America those are the people we respect most.



LADY CAROLINE.  I have no doubt of it.



HESTER.  Mr. Arbuthnot has a beautiful nature!  He is so simple, so

sincere.  He has one of the most beautiful natures I have ever come

across.  It is a privilege to meet _him_.



LADY CAROLINE.  It is not customary in England, Miss Worsley, for a young

lady to speak with such enthusiasm of any person of the opposite sex.

English women conceal their feelings till after they are married.  They

show them then.



HESTER.  Do you, in England, allow no friendship to exist between a young

man and a young girl?



[_Enter_ LADY HUNSTANTON, _followed by Footman with shawls and a

cushion_.]



LADY CAROLINE.  We think it very inadvisable.  Jane, I was just saying

what a pleasant party you have asked us to meet.  You have a wonderful

power of selection.  It is quite a gift.



LADY HUNSTANTON.  Dear Caroline, how kind of you!  I think we all do fit

in very nicely together.  And I hope our charming American visitor will

carry back pleasant recollections of our English country life.  [_To

Footman_.]  The cushion, there, Francis.  And my shawl.  The Shetland.

Get the Shetland.  [_Exit Footman for shawl_.]



[_Enter_ GERALD ARBUTHNOT.]



GERALD.  Lady Hunstanton, I have such good news to tell you.  Lord

Illingworth has just offered to make me his secretary.



LADY HUNSTANTON.  His secretary?  That is good news indeed, Gerald.  It

means a very brilliant future in store for you.  Your dear mother will be

delighted.  I really must try and induce her to come up here to-night.

Do you think she would, Gerald?  I know how difficult it is to get her to

go anywhere.



GERALD.  Oh!  I am sure she would, Lady Hunstanton, if she knew Lord

Illingworth had made me such an offer.



[_Enter Footman with shawl_.]



LADY HUNSTANTON.  I will write and tell her about it, and ask her to come

up and meet him.  [_To Footman_.]  Just wait, Francis.  [_Writes

letter_.]



LADY CAROLINE.  That is a very wonderful opening for so young a man as

you are, Mr. Arbuthnot.



GERALD.  It is indeed, Lady Caroline.  I trust I shall be able to show

myself worthy of it.



LADY CAROLINE.  I trust so.



GERALD.  [_To_ HESTER.]  _You_ have not congratulated me yet, Miss

Worsley.



HESTER.  Are you very pleased about it?



GERALD.  Of course I am.  It means everything to me—things that were out

of the reach of hope before may be within hope’s reach now.



HESTER.  Nothing should be out of the reach of hope.  Life is a hope.



LADY HUNSTANTON.  I fancy, Caroline, that Diplomacy is what Lord

Illingworth is aiming at.  I heard that he was offered Vienna.  But that

may not be true.



LADY CAROLINE.  I don’t think that England should be represented abroad

by an unmarried man, Jane.  It might lead to complications.



LADY HUNSTANTON.  You are too nervous, Caroline.  Believe me, you are too

nervous.  Besides, Lord Illingworth may marry any day.  I was in hopes he

would have married lady Kelso.  But I believe he said her family was too

large.  Or was it her feet?  I forget which.  I regret it very much.  She

was made to be an ambassador’s wife.



LADY CAROLINE.  She certainly has a wonderful faculty of remembering

people’s names, and forgetting their faces.



LADY HUNSTANTON.  Well, that is very natural, Caroline, is it not?  [_To

Footman_.]  Tell Henry to wait for an answer.  I have written a line to

your dear mother, Gerald, to tell her your good news, and to say she

really must come to dinner.



[_Exit Footman_.]



GERALD.  That is awfully kind of you, Lady Hunstanton.  [_To_ HESTER.]

Will you come for a stroll, Miss Worsley?



HESTER.  With pleasure.  [_Exit with_ GERALD.]



LADY HUNSTANTON.  I am very much gratified at Gerald Arbuthnot’s good

fortune.  He is quite a _protégé_ of mine.  And I am particularly pleased

that Lord Illingworth should have made the offer of his own accord

without my suggesting anything.  Nobody likes to be asked favours.  I

remember poor Charlotte Pagden making herself quite unpopular one season,

because she had a French governess she wanted to recommend to every one.



LADY CAROLINE.  I saw the governess, Jane.  Lady Pagden sent her to me.

It was before Eleanor came out.  She was far too good-looking to be in

any respectable household.  I don’t wonder Lady Pagden was so anxious to

get rid of her.



LADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, that explains it.



LADY CAROLINE.  John, the grass is too damp for you.  You had better go

and put on your overshoes at once.



SIR JOHN.  I am quite comfortable, Caroline, I assure you.



LADY CAROLINE.  You must allow me to be the best judge of that, John.

Pray do as I tell you.



[SIR JOHN _gets up and goes off_.]



LADY HUNSTANTON.  You spoil him, Caroline, you do indeed!



[_Enter_ MRS. ALLONBY _and_ LADY STUTFIELD.]



[_To_ MRS. ALLONBY.]  Well, dear, I hope you like the park.  It is said

to be well timbered.



MRS. ALLONBY.  The trees are wonderful, Lady Hunstanton.



LADY STUTFIELD.  Quite, quite wonderful.



MRS. ALLONBY.  But somehow, I feel sure that if I lived in the country

for six months, I should become so unsophisticated that no one would take

the slightest notice of me.



LADY HUNSTANTON.  I assure you, dear, that the country has not that

effect at all.  Why, it was from Melthorpe, which is only two miles from

here, that Lady Belton eloped with Lord Fethersdale.  I remember the

occurrence perfectly.  Poor Lord Belton died three days afterwards of

joy, or gout.  I forget which.  We had a large party staying here at the

time, so we were all very much interested in the whole affair.



MRS. ALLONBY.  I think to elope is cowardly.  It’s running away from

danger.  And danger has become so rare in modern life.



LADY CAROLINE.  As far as I can make out, the young women of the present

day seem to make it the sole object of their lives to be always playing

with fire.



MRS. ALLONBY.  The one advantage of playing with fire, Lady Caroline, is

that one never gets even singed.  It is the people who don’t know how to

play with it who get burned up.



LADY STUTFIELD.  Yes; I see that.  It is very, very helpful.



LADY HUNSTANTON.  I don’t know how the world would get on with such a

theory as that, dear Mrs. Allonby.



LADY STUTFIELD.  Ah!  The world was made for men and not for women.



MRS. ALLONBY.  Oh, don’t say that, Lady Stutfield.  We have a much better

time than they have.  There are far more things forbidden to us than are

forbidden to them.



LADY STUTFIELD.  Yes; that is quite, quite true.  I had not thought of

that.



[_Enter_ SIR JOHN _and_ MR. KELVIL.]



LADY HUNSTANTON.  Well, Mr. Kelvil, have you got through your work?



KELVIL.  I have finished my writing for the day, Lady Hunstanton.  It has

been an arduous task.  The demands on the time of a public man are very

heavy nowadays, very heavy indeed.  And I don’t think they meet with

adequate recognition.



LADY CAROLINE.  John, have you got your overshoes on?



SIR JOHN.  Yes, my love.



LADY CAROLINE.  I think you had better come over here, John.  It is more

sheltered.



SIR JOHN.  I am quite comfortable, Caroline.



LADY CAROLINE.  I think not, John.  You had better sit beside me.  [SIR

JOHN _rises and goes across_.]



LADY STUTFIELD.  And what have you been writing about this morning, Mr.

Kelvil?



KELVIL.  On the usual subject, Lady Stutfield.  On Purity.



LADY STUTFIELD.  That must be such a very, very interesting thing to

write about.



KELVIL.  It is the one subject of really national importance, nowadays,

Lady Stutfield.  I purpose addressing my constituents on the question

before Parliament meets.  I find that the poorer classes of this country

display a marked desire for a higher ethical standard.



LADY STUTFIELD.  How quite, quite nice of them.



LADY CAROLINE.  Are you in favour of women taking part in politics, Mr.

Kettle?



SIR JOHN.  Kelvil, my love, Kelvil.



KELVIL.  The growing influence of women is the one reassuring thing in

our political life, Lady Caroline.  Women are always on the side of

morality, public and private.



LADY STUTFIELD.  It is so very, very gratifying to hear you say that.



LADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, yes!—the moral qualities in women—that is the

important thing.  I am afraid, Caroline, that dear Lord Illingworth

doesn’t value the moral qualities in women as much as he should.



[_Enter_ LORD ILLINGWORTH.]



LADY STUTFIELD.  The world says that Lord Illingworth is very, very

wicked.



LORD ILLINGWORTH.  But what world says that, Lady Stutfield?  It must be

the next world.  This world and I are on excellent terms.  [_Sits down

beside_ MRS. ALLONBY.]



LADY STUTFIELD.  Every one _I_ know says you are very, very wicked.



LORD ILLINGWORTH.  It is perfectly monstrous the way people go about,

nowadays, saying things against one behind one’s back that are absolutely

and entirely true.



LADY HUNSTANTON.  Dear Lord Illingworth is quite hopeless, Lady

Stutfield.  I have given up trying to reform him.  It would take a Public

Company with a Board of Directors and a paid Secretary to do that.  But

you have the secretary already, Lord Illingworth, haven’t you?  Gerald

Arbuthnot has told us of his good fortune; it is really most kind of you.



LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Oh, don’t say that, Lady Hunstanton.  Kind is a

dreadful word.  I took a great fancy to young Arbuthnot the moment I met

him, and he’ll be of considerable use to me in something I am foolish

enough to think of doing.



LADY HUNSTANTON.  He is an admirable young man.  And his mother is one of

my dearest friends.  He has just gone for a walk with our pretty

American.  She is very pretty, is she not?



LADY CAROLINE.  Far too pretty.  These American girls carry off all the

good matches.  Why can’t they stay in their own country?  They are always

telling us it is the Paradise of women.



LORD ILLINGWORTH.  It is, Lady Caroline.  That is why, like Eve, they are

so extremely anxious to get out of it.



LADY CAROLINE.  Who are Miss Worsley’s parents?



LORD ILLINGWORTH.  American women are wonderfully clever in concealing

their parents.



LADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear Lord Illingworth, what do you mean?  Miss

Worsley, Caroline, is an orphan.  Her father was a very wealthy

millionaire or philanthropist, or both, I believe, who entertained my son

quite hospitably, when he visited Boston.  I don’t know how he made his

money, originally.



KELVIL.  I fancy in American dry goods.



LADY HUNSTANTON.  What are American dry goods?



LORD ILLINGWORTH.  American novels.



LADY HUNSTANTON.  How very singular! . . . Well, from whatever source her

large fortune came, I have a great esteem for Miss Worsley.  She dresses

exceedingly well.  All Americans do dress well.  They get their clothes

in Paris.



MRS. ALLONBY.  They say, Lady Hunstanton, that when good Americans die

they go to Paris.



LADY HUNSTANTON.  Indeed?  And when bad Americans die, where do they go

to?



LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Oh, they go to America.



KELVIL.  I am afraid you don’t appreciate America, Lord Illingworth.  It

is a very remarkable country, especially considering its youth.



LORD ILLINGWORTH.  The youth of America is their oldest tradition.  It

has been going on now for three hundred years.  To hear them talk one

would imagine they were in their first childhood.  As far as civilisation

goes they are in their second.



KELVIL.  There is undoubtedly a great deal of corruption in American

politics.  I suppose you allude to that?



LORD ILLINGWORTH.  I wonder.



LADY HUNSTANTON.  Politics are in a sad way everywhere, I am told.  They

certainly are in England.  Dear Mr. Cardew is ruining the country.  I

wonder Mrs. Cardew allows him.  I am sure, Lord Illingworth, you don’t

think that uneducated people should be allowed to have votes?
