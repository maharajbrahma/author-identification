He did not wear his scarlet coat,

                 For blood and wine are red,

               And blood and wine were on his hands

                 When they found him with the dead,

               The poor dead woman whom he loved,

                 And murdered in her bed.



               He walked amongst the Trial Men

                 In a suit of shabby grey;

               A cricket cap was on his head,

                 And his step seemed light and gay;

               But I never saw a man who looked

                 So wistfully at the day.



               I never saw a man who looked

                 With such a wistful eye

               Upon that little tent of blue

                 Which prisoners call the sky,

               And at every drifting cloud that went

                 With sails of silver by.



               I walked, with other souls in pain,

                 Within another ring,

               And was wondering if the man had done

                 A great or little thing,

               When a voice behind me whispered low,

                 "That fellow's got to swing."



               Dear Christ! the very prison walls

                 Suddenly seemed to reel,

               And the sky above my head became

                 Like a casque of scorching steel;

               And, though I was a soul in pain,

                 My pain I could not feel.



               I only knew what hunted thought

                 Quickened his step, and why

               He looked upon the garish day

                 With such a wistful eye;

               The man had killed the thing he loved

                 And so he had to die.



               Yet each man kills the thing he loves
                 By each let this be heard,

               Some do it with a bitter look,

                 Some with a flattering word,

               The coward does it with a kiss,

                 The brave man with a sword!



               Some kill their love when they are young,

                 And some when they are old;

               Some strangle with the hands of Lust,

                 Some with the hands of Gold:

               The kindest use a knife, because

                 The dead so soon grow cold.



               Some love too little, some too long,

                 Some sell, and others buy;

               Some do the deed with many tears,

                 And some without a sigh:

               For each man kills the thing he loves,

                 Yet each man does not die.



               He does not die a death of shame

                 On a day of dark disgrace,

               Nor have a noose about his neck,

                 Nor a cloth upon his face,

               Nor drop feet foremost through the floor

                 Into an empty place



               He does not sit with silent men

                 Who watch him night and day;

               Who watch him when he tries to weep,

                 And when he tries to pray;

               Who watch him lest himself should rob

                 The prison of its prey.



               He does not wake at dawn to see

                 Dread figures throng his room,

               The shivering Chaplain robed in white,

                 The Sheriff stern with gloom,

               And the Governor all in shiny black,

                 With the yellow face of Doom.



               He does not rise in piteous haste

                 To put on convict-clothes,
               While some coarse-mouthed Doctor gloats, and notes

                 Each new and nerve-twitched pose,

               Fingering a watch whose little ticks

                 Are like horrible hammer-blows.



               He does not know that sickening thirst

                 That sands one's throat, before

               The hangman with his gardener's gloves

                 Slips through the padded door,

               And binds one with three leathern thongs,

                 That the throat may thirst no more.



               He does not bend his head to hear

                 The Burial Office read,

               Nor, while the terror of his soul

                 Tells him he is not dead,

               Cross his own coffin, as he moves

                 Into the hideous shed.



               He does not stare upon the air

                 Through a little roof of glass;

               He does not pray with lips of clay

                 For his agony to pass;

               Nor feel upon his shuddering cheek

                 The kiss of Caiaphas.

               Six weeks our guardsman walked the yard,

                 In a suit of shabby grey:

               His cricket cap was on his head,

                 And his step seemed light and gay,

               But I never saw a man who looked

                 So wistfully at the day.



               I never saw a man who looked

                 With such a wistful eye

               Upon that little tent of blue

                 Which prisoners call the sky,

               And at every wandering cloud that trailed

                 Its raveled fleeces by.



               He did not wring his hands, as do

                 Those witless men who dare

               To try to rear the changeling Hope

                 In the cave of black Despair:

               He only looked upon the sun,

                 And drank the morning air.



               He did not wring his hands nor weep,

                 Nor did he peek or pine,

               But he drank the air as though it held

                 Some healthful anodyne;

               With open mouth he drank the sun

                 As though it had been wine!



               And I and all the souls in pain,

                 Who tramped the other ring,

               Forgot if we ourselves had done

                 A great or little thing,

               And watched with gaze of dull amaze

                 The man who had to swing.



               And strange it was to see him pass

                 With a step so light and gay,
               And strange it was to see him look

                 So wistfully at the day,

               And strange it was to think that he

                 Had such a debt to pay.



               For oak and elm have pleasant leaves

                 That in the spring-time shoot:

               But grim to see is the gallows-tree,

                 With its adder-bitten root,

               And, green or dry, a man must die

                 Before it bears its fruit!



               The loftiest place is that seat of grace

                 For which all worldlings try:

               But who would stand in hempen band

                 Upon a scaffold high,

               And through a murderer's collar take

                 His last look at the sky?



               It is sweet to dance to violins

                 When Love and Life are fair:

               To dance to flutes, to dance to lutes

                 Is delicate and rare:

               But it is not sweet with nimble feet

                 To dance upon the air!



               So with curious eyes and sick surmise

                 We watched him day by day,

               And wondered if each one of us

                 Would end the self-same way,

               For none can tell to what red Hell

                 His sightless soul may stray.



               At last the dead man walked no more

                 Amongst the Trial Men,

               And I knew that he was standing up

                 In the black dock's dreadful pen,

               And that never would I see his face

                 In God's sweet world again.



               Like two doomed ships that pass in storm
                 We had crossed each other's way:

               But we made no sign, we said no word,

                 We had no word to say;

               For we did not meet in the holy night,

                 But in the shameful day.



               A prison wall was round us both,

                 Two outcast men were we:

               The world had thrust us from its heart,

                 And God from out His care:

               And the iron gin that waits for Sin

                 Had caught us in its snare.



               In Debtors' Yard the stones are hard,

                 And the dripping wall is high,

               So it was there he took the air

                 Beneath the leaden sky,

               And by each side a Warder walked,

                 For fear the man might die.



               Or else he sat with those who watched

                 His anguish night and day;

               Who watched him when he rose to weep,

                 And when he crouched to pray;

               Who watched him lest himself should rob

                 Their scaffold of its prey.



               The Governor was strong upon

                 The Regulations Act:

               The Doctor said that Death was but

                 A scientific fact:

               And twice a day the Chaplain called

                 And left a little tract.
