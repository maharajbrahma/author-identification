That cannot be. There is no man who hath seen God since the

prophet Elias. He is the last man who saw God. In these days God

doth not show Himself. He hideth Himself. Therefore great evils

have come upon the land.



ANOTHER JEW



Verily, no man knoweth if Elias the prophet did indeed see God.

Peradventure it was but the shadow of God that he saw.



A THIRD JEW



God is at no time hidden. He showeth Himself at all times and in

everything. God is in what is evil even as He is in what is good.



A FOURTH JEW



That must not be said. It is a very dangerous doctrine. It is a

doctrine that cometh from the schools at Alexandria, where men

teach the philosophy of the Greeks. And the Greeks are Gentiles:

They are not even circumcised.



A FIFTH JEW



No one can tell how God worketh. His ways are very mysterious. It

may be that the things which we call evil are good, and that the

things which we call good are evil. There is no knowledge of any

thing. We must needs submit to everything, for God is very

strong. He breaketh in pieces the strong together with the weak,

for He regardeth not any man.



FIRST JEW



Thou speaketh truly. God is terrible; He breaketh the strong and

the weak as a man brays corn in a mortar. But this man hath never

seen God. No man hath seen God since the prophet Elias.



HERODIAS



Make them be silent. They weary me.



HEROD



But I have heard it said that Jokanaan himself is your prophet

Elias.



THE JEW



That cannot be. It is more than three hundred years since the

days of the prophet Elias.



HEROD



There be some who say that this man is the prophet Elias..



A NAZARENE



I am sure that he is the prophet Elias.



THE JEW



Nay, but he is not the prophet Elias.



THE VOICE OF JOKANAAN



So the day is come, the day of the Lord, and I hear upon the

mountains the feet of Him who shall be the Saviour of the world.



HEROD



What does that mean? The Saviour of the world.



TIGELLINUS



It is a title that Cæsar takes.



HEROD



But Cæsar is not coming into Judæa. Only yesterday I received

letters from Rome. They contained nothing concerning this matter.

And you, Tigellinus, who were at Rome during the winter, you

heard nothing concerning this matter, did you?



TIGELLINUS



Sire, I heard nothing concerning the matter. I was explaining the

title. It is one of Cæsar's titles.



HEROD



But Cæsar cannot come. He is too gouty. They say that his feet

are like the feet of an elephant. Also there are reasons of

State. He who leaves Rome loses Rome. He will not come. Howbeit,

Cæsar is lord, he will come if he wishes. Nevertheless, I do not

think he will come.



FIRST NAZARENE



It was not concerning Cæsar that the prophet spake these words,

sire.



HEROD



Not of Cæsar?



FIRST NAZARENE



No, sire.



HEROD



Concerning whom then did he speak?



FIRST NAZARENE



Concerning Messias who has come.



A JEW



Messiah hath not come.



FIRST NAZARENE



He hath come, and everywhere He worketh miracles.



HERODIAS Ho! ho! miracles! I do not believe in miracles. I have

seen too many. [_To the page._] My fan!



FIRST NAZARENE



This man worketh true miracles. Thus, at a marriage which took

place in a little town of Galilee, a town of some importance, He

changed water into wine. Certain persons who were present related

it to me. Also He healed two lepers that were seated before the

Gate of Capernaum simply by touching them.



SECOND NAZARENE



Nay, it was blind men that he healed at Capernaum.



FIRST NAZARENE



Nay; they were lepers. But He hath healed blind people also, and

He was seen on a mountain talking with angels.



A SADDUCEE



Angels do not exist.



A PHARISEE



Angels exist, but I do not believe that this Man has talked with

them.



FIRST NAZARENE



He was seen by a great multitude of people talking with angels.



A SADDUCEE



Not with angels.



HERODIAS



How these men weary me! They are ridiculous! [_To the page._]

Well! my fan! [_The page gives her the fan._] You have a

dreamer's look; you must not dream. It is only sick people who

dream. [_She strikes the page with her fan._]



SECOND NAZARENE



There is also the miracle of the daughter of Jairus.



FIRST NAZARENE



Yes, that is sure. No man can gainsay it.



HERODIAS



These men are mad. They have looked too long on the moon. Command

them to be silent.



HEROD



What is this miracle of the daughter of Jairus?



FIRST NAZARENE



The daughter of Jairus was dead. He raised her from the dead.



HEROD



He raises the dead?



FIRST NAZARENE



Yea, sire, He raiseth the dead.



HEROD



I do not wish Him to do that. I forbid Him to do that. I allow no

man to raise the dead. This Man must be found and told that I

forbid Him to raise the dead. Where is this Man at present?



SECOND NAZARENE



He is in every place, my lord, but it is hard to find Him.



FIRST NAZARENE



It is said that He is now in Samaria.



A JEW



It is easy to see that this is not Messias, if He is in Samaria.

It is not to the Samaritans that Messias shall come. The

Samaritans are accursed. They bring no offerings to the Temple.



SECOND NAZARENE



He left Samaria a few days since. I think that at the present

moment He is in the neighbourhood of Jerusalem.



FIRST NAZARENE



No; He is not there. I have just come from Jerusalem. For two

months they have had no tidings of Him.



HEROD



No matter! But let them find Him, and tell Him from me, I will

not allow him to raise the dead! To change water into wine, to

heal the lepers and the blind.... He may do these things if He

will. I say nothing against these things. In truth I hold it a

good deed to heal a leper. But I allow no man to raise the dead.

It would be terrible if the dead came back.
