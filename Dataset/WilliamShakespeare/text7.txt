 Tyb. I am for you.                                    [Draws.]



  Rom. Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.



  Mer. Come, sir, your passado!

                                                   [They fight.]



  Rom. Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.

    Gentlemen, for shame! forbear this outrage!

    Tybalt, Mercutio, the Prince expressly hath

    Forbid this bandying in Verona streets.

    Hold, Tybalt! Good Mercutio!

         Tybalt under Romeo's arm thrusts Mercutio in, and flies

                                           [with his Followers].



  Mer. I am hurt.

    A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.

    Is he gone and hath nothing?



  Ben. What, art thou hurt?



  Mer. Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Marry, 'tis enough.

    Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.

                                                    [Exit Page.]



  Rom. Courage, man. The hurt cannot be much.



  Mer. No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church door;

    but 'tis enough, 'twill serve. Ask for me to-morrow, and you

    shall find me a grave man. I am peppered, I warrant, for this

    world. A plague o' both your houses! Zounds, a dog, a rat, a

    mouse, a cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a rogue,

a

    villain, that fights by the book of arithmetic! Why the devil

    came you between us? I was hurt under your arm.



  Rom. I thought all for the best.



  Mer. Help me into some house, Benvolio,

    Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!

    They have made worms' meat of me. I have it,

    And soundly too. Your houses!

                                 [Exit. [supported by Benvolio].



  Rom. This gentleman, the Prince's near ally,

    My very friend, hath got this mortal hurt

    In my behalf- my reputation stain'd

    With Tybalt's slander- Tybalt, that an hour

    Hath been my kinsman. O sweet Juliet,

    Thy beauty hath made me effeminate

    And in my temper soft'ned valour's steel



                      Enter Benvolio.





  Ben. O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!

    That gallant spirit hath aspir'd the clouds,

    Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.



  Rom. This day's black fate on moe days doth depend;

    This but begins the woe others must end.



                       Enter Tybalt.





  Ben. Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.



  Rom. Alive in triumph, and Mercutio slain?

    Away to heaven respective lenity,

    And fire-ey'd fury be my conduct now!

    Now, Tybalt, take the 'villain' back again

    That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul

    Is but a little way above our heads,

    Staying for thine to keep him company.

    Either thou or I, or both, must go with him.



  Tyb. Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,

    Shalt with him hence.



  Rom. This shall determine that.

                                       They fight. Tybalt falls.



  Ben. Romeo, away, be gone!

    The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.

    Stand not amaz'd. The Prince will doom thee death

    If thou art taken. Hence, be gone, away!



  Rom. O, I am fortune's fool!



  Ben. Why dost thou stay?

                                                     Exit Romeo.

                      Enter Citizens.





  Citizen. Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio?

    Tybalt, that murtherer, which way ran he?



  Ben. There lies that Tybalt.



  Citizen. Up, sir, go with me.

    I charge thee in the Prince's name obey.





  Enter Prince [attended], Old Montague, Capulet, their Wives,

                     and [others].





  Prince. Where are the vile beginners of this fray?



  Ben. O noble Prince. I can discover all

    The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl.

    There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,

    That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.



  Cap. Wife. Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!

    O Prince! O husband! O, the blood is spill'd

    Of my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,

    For blood of ours shed blood of Montague.

    O cousin, cousin!



  Prince. Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?



  Ben. Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did stay.

    Romeo, that spoke him fair, bid him bethink

    How nice the quarrel was, and urg'd withal

    Your high displeasure. All this- uttered

    With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd-

    Could not take truce with the unruly spleen

    Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts

    With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast;

    Who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point,

    And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats

    Cold death aside and with the other sends

    It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity

    Retorts it. Romeo he cries aloud,

    'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and swifter than his tongue,

    His agile arm beats down their fatal points,

    And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm

    An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life

    Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;

    But by-and-by comes back to Romeo,

    Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,

    And to't they go like lightning; for, ere I

    Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain;

    And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.

    This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.



  Cap. Wife. He is a kinsman to the Montague;

    Affection makes him false, he speaks not true.

    Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,

    And all those twenty could but kill one life.

    I beg for justice, which thou, Prince, must give.

    Romeo slew Tybalt; Romeo must not live.



  Prince. Romeo slew him; he slew Mercutio.

    Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?



  Mon. Not Romeo, Prince; he was Mercutio's friend;

    His fault concludes but what the law should end,

    The life of Tybalt.



  Prince. And for that offence

    Immediately we do exile him hence.

    I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,

    My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;

    But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine

    That you shall all repent the loss of mine.

    I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;

    Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses.

    Therefore use none. Let Romeo hence in haste,

    Else, when he is found, that hour is his last.

    Bear hence this body, and attend our will.

    Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.Enter Juliet alone.





  Jul. Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,

    Towards Phoebus' lodging! Such a wagoner

    As Phaeton would whip you to the West

    And bring in cloudy night immediately.

    Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,

    That runaway eyes may wink, and Romeo

    Leap to these arms untalk'd of and unseen.

    Lovers can see to do their amorous rites

    By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,

    It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,

    Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,

    And learn me how to lose a winning match,

    Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods.

    Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,

    With thy black mantle till strange love, grown bold,

    Think true love acted simple modesty.

    Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;

    For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night

    Whiter than new snow upon a raven's back.

    Come, gentle night; come, loving, black-brow'd night;

    Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,

    Take him and cut him out in little stars,

    And he will make the face of heaven so fine

    That all the world will be in love with night

    And pay no worship to the garish sun.

    O, I have bought the mansion of a love,

    But not possess'd it; and though I am sold,

    Not yet enjoy'd. So tedious is this day

    As is the night before some festival

    To an impatient child that hath new robes

    And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,



                Enter Nurse, with cords.



    And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks

    But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.

    Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords

    That Romeo bid thee fetch?



  Nurse. Ay, ay, the cords.

                                             [Throws them down.]



  Jul. Ay me! what news? Why dost thou wring thy hands



  Nurse. Ah, weraday! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!

    We are undone, lady, we are undone!

    Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!



  Jul. Can heaven be so envious?



  Nurse. Romeo can,

    Though heaven cannot. O Romeo, Romeo!

    Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!



  Jul. What devil art thou that dost torment me thus?

    This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.

    Hath Romeo slain himself? Say thou but 'I,'

    And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more

    Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice.

    I am not I, if there be such an 'I';

    Or those eyes shut that make thee answer 'I.'

    If be be slain, say 'I'; or if not, 'no.'

    Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.



  Nurse. I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,

    (God save the mark!) here on his manly breast.

    A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;

    Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,

    All in gore-blood. I swounded at the sight.



  Jul. O, break, my heart! poor bankrout, break at once!

    To prison, eyes; ne'er look on liberty!

    Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here,

    And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!



  Nurse. O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!

    O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman

    That ever I should live to see thee dead!



  Jul. What storm is this that blows so contrary?

    Is Romeo slaught'red, and is Tybalt dead?

    My dear-lov'd cousin, and my dearer lord?

    Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!

    For who is living, if those two are gone?



  Nurse. Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;

    Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.



  Jul. O God! Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?



  Nurse. It did, it did! alas the day, it did!



  Jul. O serpent heart, hid with a flow'ring face!

    Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?

    Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!

    Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!

    Despised substance of divinest show!

    Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st-

    A damned saint, an honourable villain!

    O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell

    When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend

    In mortal paradise of such sweet flesh?

    Was ever book containing such vile matter

    So fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell

    In such a gorgeous palace!



  Nurse. There's no trust,

    No faith, no honesty in men; all perjur'd,

    All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.

    Ah, where's my man? Give me some aqua vitae.

    These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.

    Shame come to Romeo!



  Jul. Blister'd be thy tongue

    For such a wish! He was not born to shame.

    Upon his brow shame is asham'd to sit;

    For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd

    Sole monarch of the universal earth.

    O, what a beast was I to chide at him!



  Nurse. Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?



  Jul. Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?

    Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name

    When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?

    But wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?

    That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband.

    Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring!

    Your tributary drops belong to woe,

    Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.

    My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;

    And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband.

    All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?

    Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,

    That murd'red me. I would forget it fain;

    But O, it presses to my memory

    Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds!

    'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo- banished.'

    That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'

    Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death

    Was woe enough, if it had ended there;

    Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship

    And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,

    Why followed not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'

    Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,

    Which modern lamentation might have mov'd?

    But with a rearward following Tybalt's death,

    'Romeo is banished'- to speak that word

    Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,

    All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished'-

    There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,

    In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.

    Where is my father and my mother, nurse?



  Nurse. Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse.

    Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.
