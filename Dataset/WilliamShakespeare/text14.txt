Bal. It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,

    One that you love.



  Friar. Who is it?



  Bal. Romeo.



  Friar. How long hath he been there?



  Bal. Full half an hour.



  Friar. Go with me to the vault.



  Bal. I dare not, sir.

    My master knows not but I am gone hence,

    And fearfully did menace me with death

    If I did stay to look on his intents.



  Friar. Stay then; I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me.

    O, much I fear some ill unthrifty thing.



  Bal. As I did sleep under this yew tree here,

    I dreamt my master and another fought,

    And that my master slew him.



  Friar. Romeo!

    Alack, alack, what blood is this which stains

    The stony entrance of this sepulchre?

    What mean these masterless and gory swords

    To lie discolour'd by this place of peace? [Enters the tomb.]

    Romeo! O, pale! Who else? What, Paris too?

    And steep'd in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour

    Is guilty of this lamentable chance! The lady stirs.

                                                   Juliet rises.



  Jul. O comfortable friar! where is my lord?

    I do remember well where I should be,

    And there I am. Where is my Romeo?



  Friar. I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest

    Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep.

    A greater power than we can contradict

    Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.

    Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;

    And Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of thee

    Among a sisterhood of holy nuns.

    Stay not to question, for the watch is coming.

    Come, go, good Juliet. I dare no longer stay.



  Jul. Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.

                                                   Exit [Friar].

    What's here? A cup, clos'd in my true love's hand?

    Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end.

    O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop

    To help me after? I will kiss thy lips.

    Haply some poison yet doth hang on them

    To make me die with a restorative.             [Kisses him.]

    Thy lips are warm!



  Chief Watch. [within] Lead, boy. Which way?

    Yea, noise? Then I'll be brief. O happy dagger!

                                      [Snatches Romeo's dagger.]

    This is thy sheath; there rest, and let me die.

                  She stabs herself and falls [on Romeo's body].



                Enter [Paris's] Boy and Watch.





  Boy. This is the place. There, where the torch doth burn.



  Chief Watch. 'the ground is bloody. Search about the churchyard.

    Go, some of you; whoe'er you find attach.

                                     [Exeunt some of the Watch.]

    Pitiful sight! here lies the County slain;

    And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,

    Who here hath lain this two days buried.

    Go, tell the Prince; run to the Capulets;

    Raise up the Montagues; some others search.

                                   [Exeunt others of the Watch.]

    We see the ground whereon these woes do lie,

    But the true ground of all these piteous woes

    We cannot without circumstance descry.



     Enter [some of the Watch,] with Romeo's Man [Balthasar].



  2. Watch. Here's Romeo's man. We found him in the churchyard.



  Chief Watch. Hold him in safety till the Prince come hither.



          Enter Friar [Laurence] and another Watchman.



  3. Watch. Here is a friar that trembles, sighs, and weeps.

    We took this mattock and this spade from him

    As he was coming from this churchyard side.



  Chief Watch. A great suspicion! Stay the friar too.



              Enter the Prince [and Attendants].





  Prince. What misadventure is so early up,

    That calls our person from our morning rest?



            Enter Capulet and his Wife [with others].





  Cap. What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?



  Wife. The people in the street cry 'Romeo,'

    Some 'Juliet,' and some 'Paris'; and all run,

    With open outcry, toward our monument.



  Prince. What fear is this which startles in our ears?



  Chief Watch. Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;

    And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,

    Warm and new kill'd.



  Prince. Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.



  Chief Watch. Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man,

    With instruments upon them fit to open

    These dead men's tombs.



  Cap. O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!

    This dagger hath mista'en, for, lo, his house

    Is empty on the back of Montague,

    And it missheathed in my daughter's bosom!



  Wife. O me! this sight of death is as a bell

    That warns my old age to a sepulchre.



               Enter Montague [and others].





  Prince. Come, Montague; for thou art early up

    To see thy son and heir more early down.



  Mon. Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night!

    Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath.

    What further woe conspires against mine age?



  Prince. Look, and thou shalt see.



  Mon. O thou untaught! what manners is in this,

    To press before thy father to a grave?



  Prince. Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,

    Till we can clear these ambiguities

    And know their spring, their head, their true descent;

    And then will I be general of your woes

    And lead you even to death. Meantime forbear,

    And let mischance be slave to patience.

    Bring forth the parties of suspicion.



  Friar. I am the greatest, able to do least,

    Yet most suspected, as the time and place

    Doth make against me, of this direful murther;

    And here I stand, both to impeach and purge

    Myself condemned and myself excus'd.



  Prince. Then say it once what thou dost know in this.



  Friar. I will be brief, for my short date of breath

    Is not so long as is a tedious tale.

    Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;

    And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife.

    I married them; and their stol'n marriage day

    Was Tybalt's doomsday, whose untimely death

    Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from this city;

    For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin'd.

    You, to remove that siege of grief from her,

    Betroth'd and would have married her perforce

    To County Paris. Then comes she to me

    And with wild looks bid me devise some mean

    To rid her from this second marriage,

    Or in my cell there would she kill herself.

    Then gave I her (so tutored by my art)

    A sleeping potion; which so took effect

    As I intended, for it wrought on her

    The form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo

    That he should hither come as this dire night

    To help to take her from her borrowed grave,

    Being the time the potion's force should cease.

    But he which bore my letter, Friar John,

    Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight

    Return'd my letter back. Then all alone

    At the prefixed hour of her waking

    Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;

    Meaning to keep her closely at my cell

    Till I conveniently could send to Romeo.

    But when I came, some minute ere the time

    Of her awaking, here untimely lay

    The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.

    She wakes; and I entreated her come forth

    And bear this work of heaven with patience;

    But then a noise did scare me from the tomb,

    And she, too desperate, would not go with me,

    But, as it seems, did violence on herself.

    All this I know, and to the marriage

    Her nurse is privy; and if aught in this

    Miscarried by my fault, let my old life

    Be sacrific'd, some hour before his time,

    Unto the rigour of severest law.



  Prince. We still have known thee for a holy man.

    Where's Romeo's man? What can he say in this?



  Bal. I brought my master news of Juliet's death;

    And then in post he came from Mantua

    To this same place, to this same monument.

    This letter he early bid me give his father,

    And threat'ned me with death, going in the vault,

    If I departed not and left him there.



  Prince. Give me the letter. I will look on it.

    Where is the County's page that rais'd the watch?

    Sirrah, what made your master in this place?



  Boy. He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;

    And bid me stand aloof, and so I did.

    Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;

    And by-and-by my master drew on him;

    And then I ran away to call the watch.



  Prince. This letter doth make good the friar's words,

    Their course of love, the tidings of her death;

    And here he writes that he did buy a poison

    Of a poor pothecary, and therewithal

    Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.

    Where be these enemies? Capulet, Montage,

    See what a scourge is laid upon your hate,

    That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!

    And I, for winking at you, discords too,

    Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish'd.



  Cap. O brother Montague, give me thy hand.

    This is my daughter's jointure, for no more

    Can I demand.



  Mon. But I can give thee more;

    For I will raise her Statue in pure gold,

    That whiles Verona by that name is known,

    There shall no figure at such rate be set

    As that of true and faithful Juliet.



  Cap. As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie-

    Poor sacrifices of our enmity!



  Prince. A glooming peace this morning with it brings.

    The sun for sorrow will not show his head.

    Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;

    Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished;

    For never was a story of more woe

    Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
