Enter Old Capulet, his Wife, and Paris.





  Cap. Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily

    That we have had no time to move our daughter.

    Look you, she lov'd her kinsman Tybalt dearly,

    And so did I. Well, we were born to die.

    'Tis very late; she'll not come down to-night.

    I promise you, but for your company,

    I would have been abed an hour ago.



  Par. These times of woe afford no tune to woo.

    Madam, good night. Commend me to your daughter.



  Lady. I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;

    To-night she's mew'd up to her heaviness.



  Cap. Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender

    Of my child's love. I think she will be rul'd

    In all respects by me; nay more, I doubt it not.

    Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;

    Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love

    And bid her (mark you me?) on Wednesday next-

    But, soft! what day is this?



  Par. Monday, my lord.



  Cap. Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon.

    Thursday let it be- a Thursday, tell her

    She shall be married to this noble earl.

    Will you be ready? Do you like this haste?

    We'll keep no great ado- a friend or two;

    For hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,

    It may be thought we held him carelessly,

    Being our kinsman, if we revel much.

    Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,

    And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?



  Par. My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.



  Cap. Well, get you gone. A Thursday be it then.

    Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed;

    Prepare her, wife, against this wedding day.

    Farewell, My lord.- Light to my chamber, ho!

    Afore me, It is so very very late

    That we may call it early by-and-by.

    Good night.

                         Enter Romeo and Juliet aloft, at the Window.





  Jul. Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.

    It was the nightingale, and not the lark,

    That pierc'd the fearful hollow of thine ear.

    Nightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree.

    Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.



  Rom. It was the lark, the herald of the morn;

    No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks

    Do lace the severing clouds in yonder East.

    Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day

    Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.

    I must be gone and live, or stay and die.



  Jul. Yond light is not daylight; I know it, I.

    It is some meteor that the sun exhales

    To be to thee this night a torchbearer

    And light thee on the way to Mantua.

    Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.



  Rom. Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death.

    I am content, so thou wilt have it so.

    I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,

    'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;

    Nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat

    The vaulty heaven so high above our heads.

    I have more care to stay than will to go.

    Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.

    How is't, my soul? Let's talk; it is not day.



  Jul. It is, it is! Hie hence, be gone, away!

    It is the lark that sings so out of tune,

    Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.

    Some say the lark makes sweet division;

    This doth not so, for she divideth us.

    Some say the lark and loathed toad chang'd eyes;

    O, now I would they had chang'd voices too,

    Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,

    Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day!

    O, now be gone! More light and light it grows.



  Rom. More light and light- more dark and dark our woes!



                          Enter Nurse.





  Nurse. Madam!



  Jul. Nurse?



  Nurse. Your lady mother is coming to your chamber.

    The day is broke; be wary, look about.



  Jul. Then, window, let day in, and let life out.

                                                         [Exit.]



  Rom. Farewell, farewell! One kiss, and I'll descend.

                                                  He goeth down.



  Jul. Art thou gone so, my lord, my love, my friend?

    I must hear from thee every day in the hour,

    For in a minute there are many days.

    O, by this count I shall be much in years

    Ere I again behold my Romeo!



  Rom. Farewell!

    I will omit no opportunity

    That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.



  Jul. O, think'st thou we shall ever meet again?



  Rom. I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve

    For sweet discourses in our time to come.



  Jul. O God, I have an ill-divining soul!

    Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,

    As one dead in the bottom of a tomb.

    Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.



  Rom. And trust me, love, in my eye so do you.

    Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!

Exit.



  Jul. O Fortune, Fortune! all men call thee fickle.

    If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him

    That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, Fortune,

    For then I hope thou wilt not keep him long

    But send him back.



  Lady. [within] Ho, daughter! are you up?



  Jul. Who is't that calls? It is my lady mother.

    Is she not down so late, or up so early?

    What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?



                       Enter Mother.





  Lady. Why, how now, Juliet?



  Jul. Madam, I am not well.



  Lady. Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?

    What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?

    An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live.

    Therefore have done. Some grief shows much of love;

    But much of grief shows still some want of wit.



  Jul. Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.



  Lady. So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend

    Which you weep for.



  Jul. Feeling so the loss,

    I cannot choose but ever weep the friend.



  Lady. Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death

    As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.



  Jul. What villain, madam?



  Lady. That same villain Romeo.



  Jul. [aside] Villain and he be many miles asunder.-

    God pardon him! I do, with all my heart;

    And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.



  Lady. That is because the traitor murderer lives.
