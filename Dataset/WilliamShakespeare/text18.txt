Pol.

Marry, well bethought:

'Tis told me he hath very oft of late

Given private time to you; and you yourself

Have of your audience been most free and bounteous;

If it be so,--as so 'tis put on me,

And that in way of caution,--I must tell you

You do not understand yourself so clearly

As it behooves my daughter and your honour.

What is between you? give me up the truth.



Oph.

He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders

Of his affection to me.



Pol.

Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl,

Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.

Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?



Oph.

I do not know, my lord, what I should think.



Pol.

Marry, I'll teach you: think yourself a baby;

That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,

Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly;

Or,--not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,

Wronging it thus,--you'll tender me a fool.



Oph.

My lord, he hath importun'd me with love

In honourable fashion.



Pol.

Ay, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.



Oph.

And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,

With almost all the holy vows of heaven.



Pol.

Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,

When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul

Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,

Giving more light than heat,--extinct in both,

Even in their promise, as it is a-making,--

You must not take for fire. From this time

Be something scanter of your maiden presence;

Set your entreatments at a higher rate

Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,

Believe so much in him, that he is young;

And with a larger tether may he walk

Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia,

Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,--

Not of that dye which their investments show,

But mere implorators of unholy suits,

Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,

The better to beguile. This is for all,--

I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth

Have you so slander any moment leisure

As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.

Look to't, I charge you; come your ways.



Oph.

I shall obey, my lord.It is a nipping and an eager air.



Ham.

What hour now?



Hor.

I think it lacks of twelve.



Mar.

No, it is struck.



Hor.

Indeed? I heard it not: then draws near the season

Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.



[A flourish of trumpets, and ordnance shot off within.]



What does this mean, my lord?



Ham.

The King doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,

Keeps wassail, and the swaggering up-spring reels;

And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,

The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out

The triumph of his pledge.



Hor.

Is it a custom?



Ham.

Ay, marry, is't;

But to my mind,--though I am native here,

And to the manner born,--it is a custom

More honour'd in the breach than the observance.

This heavy-headed revel east and west

Makes us traduc'd and tax'd of other nations:

They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase

Soil our addition; and, indeed, it takes

From our achievements, though perform'd at height,

The pith and marrow of our attribute.

So oft it chances in particular men

That, for some vicious mole of nature in them,

As in their birth,--wherein they are not guilty,

Since nature cannot choose his origin,--

By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,

Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason;

Or by some habit, that too much o'er-leavens

The form of plausive manners;--that these men,--

Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,

Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,--

Their virtues else,--be they as pure as grace,

As infinite as man may undergo,--

Shall in the general censure take corruption

From that particular fault: the dram of eale

Doth all the noble substance often doubt

To his own scandal.



Hor.

Look, my lord, it comes!



[Enter Ghost.]



Ham.

Angels and ministers of grace defend us!--

Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,

Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,

Be thy intents wicked or charitable,

Thou com'st in such a questionable shape

That I will speak to thee: I'll call thee Hamlet,

King, father, royal Dane; O, answer me!

Let me not burst in ignorance; but tell

Why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in death,

Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre,

Wherein we saw thee quietly in-urn'd,

Hath op'd his ponderous and marble jaws

To cast thee up again! What may this mean,

That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel,

Revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon,

Making night hideous, and we fools of nature

So horridly to shake our disposition

With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?

Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we do?



[Ghost beckons Hamlet.]



Hor.

It beckons you to go away with it,

As if it some impartment did desire

To you alone.



Mar.

Look with what courteous action

It waves you to a more removed ground:

But do not go with it!



Hor.

No, by no means.



Ham.

It will not speak; then will I follow it.



Hor.

Do not, my lord.



Ham.

Why, what should be the fear?

I do not set my life at a pin's fee;

And for my soul, what can it do to that,

Being a thing immortal as itself?

It waves me forth again;--I'll follow it.



Hor.

What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,

Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff

That beetles o'er his base into the sea,

And there assume some other horrible form

Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason,

And draw you into madness? think of it:

The very place puts toys of desperation,

Without more motive, into every brain

That looks so many fadoms to the sea

And hears it roar beneath.



Ham.

It waves me still.--

Go on; I'll follow thee.



Mar.

You shall not go, my lord.



Ham.

Hold off your hands.



Hor.

Be rul'd; you shall not go.



Ham.

My fate cries out,

And makes each petty artery in this body

As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.--



[Ghost beckons.]



Still am I call'd;--unhand me, gentlemen;--



[Breaking free from them.]



By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!--

I say, away!--Go on; I'll follow thee.



[Exeunt Ghost and Hamlet.]



Hor.

He waxes desperate with imagination.



Mar.

Let's follow; 'tis not fit thus to obey him.



Hor.

Have after.--To what issue will this come?



Mar.

Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.



Hor.

Heaven will direct it.



Mar.

Nay, let's follow him.
