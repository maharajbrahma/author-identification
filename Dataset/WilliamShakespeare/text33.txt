Laer.

Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,

And therefore I forbid my tears: but yet

It is our trick; nature her custom holds,

Let shame say what it will: when these are gone,

The woman will be out.--Adieu, my lord:

I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze,

But that this folly douts it.



[Exit.]



King.

Let's follow, Gertrude;

How much I had to do to calm his rage!

Now fear I this will give it start again;

Therefore let's follow.

1 Clown.

Is she to be buried in Christian burial when she wilfully

seeks her own salvation?



2 Clown.

I tell thee she is; and therefore make her grave straight: the

crowner hath sat on her, and finds it Christian burial.



1 Clown.

How can that be, unless she drowned herself in her own defence?



2 Clown.

Why, 'tis found so.



1 Clown.

It must be se offendendo; it cannot be else. For here lies

the point: if I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act: and an

act hath three branches; it is to act, to do, and to perform:

argal, she drowned herself wittingly.



2 Clown.

Nay, but hear you, goodman delver,--



1 Clown.

Give me leave. Here lies the water; good: here stands the

man; good: if the man go to this water and drown himself, it is,

will he, nill he, he goes,--mark you that: but if the water come

to him and drown him, he drowns not himself; argal, he that is

not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.



2 Clown.

But is this law?



1 Clown.

Ay, marry, is't--crowner's quest law.



2 Clown.

Will you ha' the truth on't? If this had not been a

gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o' Christian burial.



1 Clown.

Why, there thou say'st: and the more pity that great folk

should have countenance in this world to drown or hang themselves

more than their even Christian.--Come, my spade. There is no

ancient gentlemen but gardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers: they

hold up Adam's profession.



2 Clown.

Was he a gentleman?



1 Clown.

He was the first that ever bore arms.



2 Clown.

Why, he had none.



1 Clown.

What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the Scripture?

The Scripture says Adam digg'd: could he dig without arms? I'll

put another question to thee: if thou answerest me not to the

purpose, confess thyself,--



2 Clown.

Go to.



1 Clown.

What is he that builds stronger than either the mason, the

shipwright, or the carpenter?



2 Clown.

The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a thousand tenants.



1 Clown.

I like thy wit well, in good faith: the gallows does well;

but how does it well? it does well to those that do ill: now,

thou dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the

church; argal, the gallows may do well to thee. To't again, come.



2 Clown.

Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or a carpenter?



1 Clown.

Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.



2 Clown.

Marry, now I can tell.



1 Clown.

To't.



2 Clown.

Mass, I cannot tell.



[Enter Hamlet and Horatio, at a distance.]



1 Clown.

Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull ass will

not mend his pace with beating; and when you are asked this

question next, say 'a grave-maker;' the houses he makes last

till doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan; fetch me a stoup of

liquor.



[Exit Second Clown.]



[Digs and sings.]



   In youth when I did love, did love,

     Methought it was very sweet;

   To contract, O, the time for, ah, my behove,

     O, methought there was nothing meet.



Ham.

Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he sings at

grave-making?



Hor.

Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.



Ham.

'Tis e'en so: the hand of little employment hath the daintier

sense.



1 Clown.

[Sings.]

   But age, with his stealing steps,

     Hath claw'd me in his clutch,

   And hath shipp'd me into the land,

     As if I had never been such.



[Throws up a skull.]



Ham.

That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once: how the

knave jowls it to the ground,as if 'twere Cain's jawbone, that

did the first murder! This might be the pate of a politician,

which this ass now o'erreaches; one that would circumvent God,

might it not?



Hor.

It might, my lord.



Ham.

Or of a courtier, which could say 'Good morrow, sweet lord!

How dost thou, good lord?' This might be my lord such-a-one, that

praised my lord such-a-one's horse when he meant to beg

it,--might it not?



Hor.

Ay, my lord.



Ham.

Why, e'en so: and now my Lady Worm's; chapless, and knocked

about the mazard with a sexton's spade: here's fine revolution,

an we had the trick to see't. Did these bones cost no more the

breeding but to play at loggets with 'em? mine ache to think

on't.



1 Clown.

[Sings.]

   A pickaxe and a spade, a spade,

     For and a shrouding sheet;

   O, a pit of clay for to be made

     For such a guest is meet.



[Throws up another skull].



Ham.

There's another: why may not that be the skull of a lawyer?

Where be his quiddits now, his quillets, his cases, his tenures,

and his tricks? why does he suffer this rude knave now to knock

him about the sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him

of his action of battery? Hum! This fellow might be in's time a

great buyer of land, with his statutes, his recognizances, his

fines, his double vouchers, his recoveries: is this the fine of

his fines, and the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine

pate full of fine dirt? will his vouchers vouch him no more of

his purchases, and double ones too, than the length and breadth

of a pair of indentures? The very conveyances of his lands will

scarcely lie in this box; and must the inheritor himself have no

more, ha?



Hor.

Not a jot more, my lord.



Ham.

Is not parchment made of sheep-skins?



Hor.

Ay, my lord, And of calf-skins too.



Ham.

They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that. I

will speak to this fellow.--Whose grave's this, sir?



1 Clown.

Mine, sir.

[Sings.]

   O, a pit of clay for to be made

     For such a guest is meet.



Ham.

I think it be thine indeed, for thou liest in't.



1 Clown.

You lie out on't, sir, and therefore 'tis not yours: for my part,

I do not lie in't, yet it is mine.



Ham.

Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine: 'tis for

the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.



1 Clown.

'Tis a quick lie, sir; 't will away again from me to you.



Ham.

What man dost thou dig it for?



1 Clown.

For no man, sir.



Ham.

What woman then?



1 Clown.

For none neither.



Ham.

Who is to be buried in't?



1 Clown.

One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's dead.



Ham.

How absolute the knave is! We must speak by the card, or

equivocation will undo us. By the Lord, Horatio, these three

years I have taken note of it, the age is grown so picked that

the toe of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he

galls his kibe.--How long hast thou been a grave-maker?



1 Clown.

Of all the days i' the year, I came to't that day that our

last King Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.



Ham.

How long is that since?



1 Clown.

Cannot you tell that? every fool can tell that: it was the

very day that young Hamlet was born,--he that is mad, and sent

into England.



Ham.

Ay, marry, why was be sent into England?



1 Clown.

Why, because he was mad: he shall recover his wits there;

or, if he do not, it's no great matter there.



Ham.

Why?



1 Clown.

'Twill not he seen in him there; there the men are as mad as he.



Ham.

How came he mad?



1 Clown.

Very strangely, they say.



Ham.

How strangely?



1 Clown.

Faith, e'en with losing his wits.



Ham.

Upon what ground?



1 Clown.

Why, here in Denmark: I have been sexton here, man and boy,

thirty years.



Ham.

How long will a man lie i' the earth ere he rot?



1 Clown.

Faith, if he be not rotten before he die,--as we have many

pocky corses now-a-days that will scarce hold the laying in,--he

will last you some eight year or nine year: a tanner will last

you nine year.



Ham.

Why he more than another?



1 Clown.

Why, sir, his hide is so tann'd with his trade that he will

keep out water a great while; and your water is a sore decayer of

your whoreson dead body. Here's a skull now; this skull hath lain

in the earth three-and-twenty years.



Ham.

Whose was it?



1 Clown.

A whoreson, mad fellow's it was: whose do you think it was?



Ham.

Nay, I know not.



1 Clown.

A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! 'a pour'd a flagon of

Rhenish on my head once. This same skull, sir, was Yorick's

skull, the king's jester.



Ham.

This?



1 Clown.

E'en that.



Ham.

Let me see. [Takes the skull.] Alas, poor Yorick!--I knew him,

Horatio; a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy: he

hath borne me on his back a thousand times; and now, how abhorred

in my imagination it is! my gorge rises at it. Here hung those

lips that I have kiss'd I know not how oft. Where be your gibes

now? your gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment, that

were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one now, to mock your

own grinning? quite chap-fallen? Now, get you to my lady's

chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thick, to this

favour she must come; make her laugh at that.--Pr'ythee, Horatio,

tell me one thing.



Hor.

What's that, my lord?



Ham.

Dost thou think Alexander looked o' this fashion i' the earth?



Hor.

E'en so.



Ham.

And smelt so? Pah!



[Throws down the skull.]



Hor.

E'en so, my lord.



Ham.

To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not

imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander till he find it

stopping a bung-hole?



Hor.

'Twere to consider too curiously to consider so.



Ham.

No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with modesty

enough, and likelihood to lead it: as thus: Alexander died,

Alexander was buried, Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is

earth; of earth we make loam; and why of that loam whereto he

was converted might they not stop a beer-barrel?

   Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,

   Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.

   O, that that earth which kept the world in awe

   Should patch a wall to expel the winter's flaw!

But soft! but soft! aside!--Here comes the king.



[Enter priests, &c, in procession; the corpse of Ophelia,

Laertes, and Mourners following; King, Queen, their Trains, &c.]



The queen, the courtiers: who is that they follow?

And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken

The corse they follow did with desperate hand

Fordo it own life: 'twas of some estate.

Couch we awhile and mark.



[Retiring with Horatio.]



Laer.

What ceremony else?



Ham.

That is Laertes,

A very noble youth: mark.



Laer.

What ceremony else?



1 Priest.

Her obsequies have been as far enlarg'd

As we have warranties: her death was doubtful;

And, but that great command o'ersways the order,

She should in ground unsanctified have lodg'd

Till the last trumpet; for charitable prayers,

Shards, flints, and pebbles should be thrown on her,

Yet here she is allowed her virgin rites,

Her maiden strewments, and the bringing home

Of bell and burial.



Laer.

Must there no more be done?



1 Priest.

No more be done;

We should profane the service of the dead

To sing a requiem and such rest to her

As to peace-parted souls.



Laer.

Lay her i' the earth;--

And from her fair and unpolluted flesh

May violets spring!--I tell thee, churlish priest,

A ministering angel shall my sister be

When thou liest howling.



Ham.

What, the fair Ophelia?



Queen.

Sweets to the sweet: farewell.

[Scattering flowers.]

I hop'd thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;

I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,

And not have strew'd thy grave.
