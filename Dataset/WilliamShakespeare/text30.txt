Ham.

What noise? who calls on Hamlet? O, here they come.



[Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]



Ros.

What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?



Ham.

Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.



Ros.

Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence,

And bear it to the chapel.



Ham.

Do not believe it.



Ros.

Believe what?



Ham.

That I can keep your counsel, and not mine own. Besides, to be

demanded of a sponge!--what replication should be made by the son

of a king?



Ros.

Take you me for a sponge, my lord?



Ham.

Ay, sir; that soaks up the King's countenance, his rewards,

his authorities. But such officers do the king best service in

the end: he keeps them, like an ape, in the corner of his jaw;

first mouthed, to be last swallowed: when he needs what you have

gleaned, it is but squeezing you, and, sponge, you shall be dry

again.



Ros.

I understand you not, my lord.



Ham.

I am glad of it: a knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.



Ros.

My lord, you must tell us where the body is and go with us to

the king.



Ham.

The body is with the king, but the king is not with the body.

The king is a thing,--



Guil.

A thing, my lord!



Ham.

Of nothing: bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.



[Exeunt.]







Scene III. Another room in the Castle.



[Enter King,attended.]



King.

I have sent to seek him and to find the body.

How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!

Yet must not we put the strong law on him:

He's lov'd of the distracted multitude,

Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;

And where 'tis so, the offender's scourge is weigh'd,

But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,

This sudden sending him away must seem

Deliberate pause: diseases desperate grown

By desperate appliance are reliev'd,

Or not at all.



[Enter Rosencrantz.]



How now! what hath befall'n?



Ros.

Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,

We cannot get from him.



King.

But where is he?



Ros.

Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.



King.

Bring him before us.



Ros.

Ho, Guildenstern! bring in my lord.



[Enter Hamlet and Guildenstern.]



King.

Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?



Ham.

At supper.



King.

At supper! where?



Ham.

Not where he eats, but where he is eaten: a certain

convocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Your worm is your

only emperor for diet: we fat all creatures else to fat us, and

we fat ourselves for maggots: your fat king and your lean beggar

is but variable service,--two dishes, but to one table: that's

the end.



King.

Alas, alas!



Ham.

A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and eat

of the fish that hath fed of that worm.



King.

What dost thou mean by this?



Ham.

Nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through

the guts of a beggar.



King.

Where is Polonius?



Ham.

In heaven: send thither to see: if your messenger find him not

there, seek him i' the other place yourself. But, indeed, if you

find him not within this month, you shall nose him as you go up

the stairs into the lobby.



King.

Go seek him there. [To some Attendants.]



Ham.

He will stay till you come.



[Exeunt Attendants.]



King.

Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,--

Which we do tender, as we dearly grieve

For that which thou hast done,--must send thee hence

With fiery quickness: therefore prepare thyself;

The bark is ready, and the wind at help,

The associates tend, and everything is bent

For England.



Ham.

For England!



King.

Ay, Hamlet.



Ham.

Good.



King.

So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.



Ham.

I see a cherub that sees them.--But, come; for England!--

Farewell, dear mother.



King.

Thy loving father, Hamlet.



Ham.

My mother: father and mother is man and wife; man and wife is

one flesh; and so, my mother.--Come, for England!



[Exit.]



King.

Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard;

Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night:

Away! for everything is seal'd and done

That else leans on the affair: pray you, make haste.



[Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]



And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught,--

As my great power thereof may give thee sense,

Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red

After the Danish sword, and thy free awe

Pays homage to us,--thou mayst not coldly set

Our sovereign process; which imports at full,

By letters conjuring to that effect,

The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;

For like the hectic in my blood he rages,

And thou must cure me: till I know 'tis done,

Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.



[Exit.]


Ham.

Good sir, whose powers are these?



Capt.

They are of Norway, sir.



Ham.

How purpos'd, sir, I pray you?



Capt.

Against some part of Poland.



Ham.

Who commands them, sir?



Capt.

The nephew to old Norway, Fortinbras.



Ham.

Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,

Or for some frontier?



Capt.

Truly to speak, and with no addition,

We go to gain a little patch of ground

That hath in it no profit but the name.

To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;

Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole

A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.



Ham.

Why, then the Polack never will defend it.



Capt.

Yes, it is already garrison'd.



Ham.

Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats

Will not debate the question of this straw:

This is the imposthume of much wealth and peace,

That inward breaks, and shows no cause without

Why the man dies.--I humbly thank you, sir.



Capt.

God b' wi' you, sir.




Ros.

Will't please you go, my lord?



Ham.

I'll be with you straight. Go a little before.

How all occasions do inform against me

And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,

If his chief good and market of his time

Be but to sleep and feed? a beast, no more.

Sure he that made us with such large discourse,

Looking before and after, gave us not

That capability and godlike reason

To fust in us unus'd. Now, whether it be

Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple

Of thinking too precisely on the event,--

A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom

And ever three parts coward,--I do not know

Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do;'

Sith I have cause, and will, and strength, and means

To do't. Examples, gross as earth, exhort me:

Witness this army, of such mass and charge,

Led by a delicate and tender prince;

Whose spirit, with divine ambition puff'd,

Makes mouths at the invisible event;

Exposing what is mortal and unsure

To all that fortune, death, and danger dare,

Even for an egg-shell. Rightly to be great

Is not to stir without great argument,

But greatly to find quarrel in a straw

When honour's at the stake. How stand I, then,

That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,

Excitements of my reason and my blood,

And let all sleep? while, to my shame, I see

The imminent death of twenty thousand men

That, for a fantasy and trick of fame,

Go to their graves like beds; fight for a plot

Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,

Which is not tomb enough and continent

To hide the slain?--O, from this time forth,

My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!



[Exit.]
