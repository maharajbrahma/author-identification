Mal. Let vs seeke out some desolate shade, & there

Weepe our sad bosomes empty



   Macd. Let vs rather

Hold fast the mortall Sword: and like good men,

Bestride our downfall Birthdome: each new Morne,

New Widdowes howle, new Orphans cry, new sorowes

Strike heauen on the face, that it resounds

As if it felt with Scotland, and yell'd out

Like Syllable of Dolour



   Mal. What I beleeue, Ile waile;

What know, beleeue; and what I can redresse,

As I shall finde the time to friend: I wil.

What you haue spoke, it may be so perchance.

This Tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,

Was once thought honest: you haue lou'd him well,

He hath not touch'd you yet. I am yong, but something

You may discerne of him through me, and wisedome

To offer vp a weake, poore innocent Lambe

T' appease an angry God



   Macd. I am not treacherous



   Malc. But Macbeth is.

A good and vertuous Nature may recoyle

In an Imperiall charge. But I shall craue your pardon:

That which you are, my thoughts cannot transpose;

Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell.

Though all things foule, would wear the brows of grace

Yet Grace must still looke so



   Macd. I haue lost my Hopes



   Malc. Perchance euen there

Where I did finde my doubts.

Why in that rawnesse left you Wife, and Childe?

Those precious Motiues, those strong knots of Loue,

Without leaue-taking. I pray you,

Let not my Iealousies, be your Dishonors,

But mine owne Safeties: you may be rightly iust,

What euer I shall thinke



   Macd. Bleed, bleed poore Country,

Great Tyrrany, lay thou thy basis sure,

For goodnesse dare not check thee: wear y thy wrongs,

The Title, is affear'd. Far thee well Lord,

I would not be the Villaine that thou think'st,

For the whole Space that's in the Tyrants Graspe,

And the rich East to boot



   Mal. Be not offended:

I speake not as in absolute feare of you:

I thinke our Country sinkes beneath the yoake,

It weepes, it bleeds, and each new day a gash

Is added to her wounds. I thinke withall,

There would be hands vplifted in my right:

And heere from gracious England haue I offer

Of goodly thousands. But for all this,

When I shall treade vpon the Tyrants head,

Or weare it on my Sword; yet my poore Country

Shall haue more vices then it had before,

More suffer, and more sundry wayes then euer,

By him that shall succeede



   Macd. What should he be?

  Mal. It is my selfe I meane: in whom I know

All the particulars of Vice so grafted,

That when they shall be open'd, blacke Macbeth

Will seeme as pure as Snow, and the poore State

Esteeme him as a Lambe, being compar'd

With my confinelesse harmes



   Macd. Not in the Legions

Of horrid Hell, can come a Diuell more damn'd

In euils, to top Macbeth



   Mal. I grant him Bloody,

Luxurious, Auaricious, False, Deceitfull,

Sodaine, Malicious, smacking of euery sinne

That ha's a name. But there's no bottome, none

In my Voluptuousnesse: Your Wiues, your Daughters,

Your Matrons, and your Maides, could not fill vp

The Cesterne of my Lust, and my Desire

All continent Impediments would ore-beare

That did oppose my will. Better Macbeth,

Then such an one to reigne



   Macd. Boundlesse intemperance

In Nature is a Tyranny: It hath beene

Th' vntimely emptying of the happy Throne,

And fall of many Kings. But feare not yet

To take vpon you what is yours: you may

Conuey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,

And yet seeme cold. The time you may so hoodwinke:

We haue willing Dames enough: there cannot be

That Vulture in you, to deuoure so many

As will to Greatnesse dedicate themselues,

Finding it so inclinde



   Mal. With this, there growes

In my most ill-composd Affection, such

A stanchlesse Auarice, that were I King,

I should cut off the Nobles for their Lands,

Desire his Iewels, and this others House,

And my more-hauing, would be as a Sawce

To make me hunger more, that I should forge

Quarrels vniust against the Good and Loyall,

Destroying them for wealth



   Macd. This Auarice

stickes deeper: growes with more pernicious roote

Then Summer-seeming Lust: and it hath bin

The Sword of our slaine Kings: yet do not feare,

Scotland hath Foysons, to fill vp your will

Of your meere Owne. All these are portable,

With other Graces weigh'd



   Mal. But I haue none. The King-becoming Graces,

As Iustice, Verity, Temp'rance, Stablenesse,

Bounty, Perseuerance, Mercy, Lowlinesse,

Deuotion, Patience, Courage, Fortitude,

I haue no rellish of them, but abound

In the diuision of each seuerall Crime,

Acting it many wayes. Nay, had I powre, I should

Poure the sweet Milke of Concord, into Hell,

Vprore the vniuersall peace, confound

All vnity on earth



   Macd. O Scotland, Scotland



   Mal. If such a one be fit to gouerne, speake:

I am as I haue spoken



   Mac. Fit to gouern? No not to liue. O Natio[n] miserable!

With an vntitled Tyrant, bloody Sceptred,

When shalt thou see thy wholsome dayes againe?

Since that the truest Issue of thy Throne

By his owne Interdiction stands accust,

And do's blaspheme his breed? Thy Royall Father

Was a most Sainted-King: the Queene that bore thee,

Oftner vpon her knees, then on her feet,

Dy'de euery day she liu'd. Fare thee well,

These Euils thou repeat'st vpon thy selfe,

Hath banish'd me from Scotland. O my Brest,

Thy hope ends heere



   Mal. Macduff, this Noble passion

Childe of integrity, hath from my soule

Wip'd the blacke Scruples, reconcil'd my thoughts

To thy good Truth, and Honor. Diuellish Macbeth,

By many of these traines, hath sought to win me

Into his power: and modest Wisedome pluckes me

From ouer-credulous hast: but God aboue

Deale betweene thee and me; For euen now

I put my selfe to thy Direction, and

Vnspeake mine owne detraction. Heere abiure

The taints, and blames I laide vpon my selfe,

For strangers to my Nature. I am yet

Vnknowne to Woman, neuer was forsworne,

Scarsely haue coueted what was mine owne.

At no time broke my Faith, would not betray

The Deuill to his Fellow, and delight

No lesse in truth then life. My first false speaking

Was this vpon my selfe. What I am truly

Is thine, and my poore Countries to command:

Whither indeed, before they heere approach

Old Seyward with ten thousand warlike men

Already at a point, was setting foorth:

Now wee'l together, and the chance of goodnesse

Be like our warranted Quarrell. Why are you silent?

  Macd. Such welcome, and vnwelcom things at once

'Tis hard to reconcile.

Enter a Doctor.



  Mal. Well, more anon. Comes the King forth

I pray you?

  Doct. I Sir: there are a crew of wretched Soules

That stay his Cure: their malady conuinces

The great assay of Art. But at his touch,

Such sanctity hath Heauen giuen his hand,

They presently amend.

Enter.



  Mal. I thanke you Doctor



   Macd. What's the Disease he meanes?

  Mal. Tis call'd the Euill.

A most myraculous worke in this good King,

Which often since my heere remaine in England,

I haue seene him do: How he solicites heauen

Himselfe best knowes: but strangely visited people

All swolne and Vlcerous, pittifull to the eye,

The meere dispaire of Surgery, he cures,

Hanging a golden stampe about their neckes,

Put on with holy Prayers, and 'tis spoken

To the succeeding Royalty he leaues

The healing Benediction. With this strange vertue,

He hath a heauenly guift of Prophesie,

And sundry Blessings hang about his Throne,

That speake him full of Grace.

Enter Rosse.



  Macd. See who comes heere



   Malc. My Countryman: but yet I know him not



   Macd. My euer gentle Cozen, welcome hither



   Malc. I know him now. Good God betimes remoue

The meanes that makes vs Strangers



   Rosse. Sir, Amen



   Macd. Stands Scotland where it did?

  Rosse. Alas poore Countrey,

Almost affraid to know it selfe. It cannot

Be call'd our Mother, but our Graue; where nothing

But who knowes nothing, is once seene to smile:

Where sighes, and groanes, and shrieks that rent the ayre

Are made, not mark'd: Where violent sorrow seemes

A Moderne extasie: The Deadmans knell,

Is there scarse ask'd for who, and good mens liues

Expire before the Flowers in their Caps,

Dying, or ere they sicken



   Macd. Oh Relation; too nice, and yet too true



   Malc. What's the newest griefe?

  Rosse. That of an houres age, doth hisse the speaker,

Each minute teemes a new one



   Macd. How do's my Wife?

  Rosse. Why well



   Macd. And all my Children?

  Rosse. Well too

  Macd. The Tyrant ha's not batter'd at their peace?

  Rosse. No, they were wel at peace, when I did leaue 'em

  Macd. Be not a niggard of your speech: How gos't?

  Rosse. When I came hither to transport the Tydings

Which I haue heauily borne, there ran a Rumour

Of many worthy Fellowes, that were out,

Which was to my beleefe witnest the rather,

For that I saw the Tyrants Power a-foot.

Now is the time of helpe: your eye in Scotland

Would create Soldiours, make our women fight,

To doffe their dire distresses



   Malc. Bee't their comfort

We are comming thither: Gracious England hath

Lent vs good Seyward, and ten thousand men,

An older, and a better Souldier, none

That Christendome giues out



   Rosse. Would I could answer

This comfort with the like. But I haue words

That would be howl'd out in the desert ayre,

Where hearing should not latch them



   Macd. What concerne they,

The generall cause, or is it a Fee-griefe

Due to some single brest?

  Rosse. No minde that's honest

But in it shares some woe, though the maine part

Pertaines to you alone



   Macd. If it be mine

Keepe it not from me, quickly let me haue it



   Rosse. Let not your eares dispise my tongue for euer,

Which shall possesse them with the heauiest sound

that euer yet they heard



   Macd. Humh: I guesse at it



   Rosse. Your Castle is surpriz'd: your Wife, and Babes

Sauagely slaughter'd: To relate the manner

Were on the Quarry of these murther'd Deere

To adde the death of you



   Malc. Mercifull Heauen:

What man, ne're pull your hat vpon your browes:

Giue sorrow words; the griefe that do's not speake,

Whispers the o're-fraught heart, and bids it breake



   Macd. My Children too?

  Ro. Wife, Children, Seruants, all that could be found



   Macd. And I must be from thence? My wife kil'd too?

  Rosse. I haue said



   Malc. Be comforted.

Let's make vs Med'cines of our great Reuenge,

To cure this deadly greefe



   Macd. He ha's no Children. All my pretty ones?

Did you say All? Oh Hell-Kite! All?

What, All my pretty Chickens, and their Damme

At one fell swoope?

  Malc. Dispute it like a man



   Macd. I shall do so:

But I must also feele it as a man;

I cannot but remember such things were

That were most precious to me: Did heauen looke on,

And would not take their part? Sinfull Macduff,

They were all strooke for thee: Naught that I am,

Not for their owne demerits, but for mine

Fell slaughter on their soules: Heauen rest them now



   Mal. Be this the Whetstone of your sword, let griefe

Conuert to anger: blunt not the heart, enrage it



   Macd. O I could play the woman with mine eyes,

And Braggart with my tongue. But gentle Heauens,

Cut short all intermission: Front to Front,

Bring thou this Fiend of Scotland, and my selfe

Within my Swords length set him, if he scape

Heauen forgiue him too



   Mal. This time goes manly:

Come go we to the King, our Power is ready,

Our lacke is nothing but our leaue. Macbeth

Is ripe for shaking, and the Powres aboue

Put on their Instruments: Receiue what cheere you may,

The Night is long, that neuer findes the Day.



Exeunt.



Actus Quintus. Scena Prima.



Enter a Doctor of Physicke, and a Wayting Gentlewoman.



  Doct. I haue too Nights watch'd with you, but can

perceiue no truth in your report. When was it shee last

walk'd?

  Gent. Since his Maiesty went into the Field, I haue

seene her rise from her bed, throw her Night-Gown vppon

her, vnlocke her Closset, take foorth paper, folde it,

write vpon't, read it, afterwards Seale it, and againe returne

to bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleepe



   Doct. A great perturbation in Nature, to receyue at

once the benefit of sleep, and do the effects of watching.

In this slumbry agitation, besides her walking, and other

actuall performances, what (at any time) haue you heard

her say?

  Gent. That Sir, which I will not report after her



   Doct. You may to me, and 'tis most meet you should



   Gent. Neither to you, nor any one, hauing no witnesse

to confirme my speech.

Enter Lady, with a Taper.



Lo you, heere she comes: This is her very guise, and vpon

my life fast asleepe: obserue her, stand close



   Doct. How came she by that light?

  Gent. Why it stood by her: she ha's light by her continually,

'tis her command



   Doct. You see her eyes are open



   Gent. I, but their sense are shut



   Doct. What is it she do's now?

Looke how she rubbes her hands



   Gent. It is an accustom'd action with her, to seeme

thus washing her hands: I haue knowne her continue in

this a quarter of an houre



   Lad. Yet heere's a spot



   Doct. Heark, she speaks, I will set downe what comes

from her, to satisfie my remembrance the more strongly



   La. Out damned spot: out I say. One: Two: Why

then 'tis time to doo't: Hell is murky. Fye, my Lord, fie,

a Souldier, and affear'd? what need we feare? who knowes

it, when none can call our powre to accompt: yet who

would haue thought the olde man to haue had so much

blood in him



   Doct. Do you marke that?

  Lad. The Thane of Fife, had a wife: where is she now?

What will these hands ne're be cleane? No more o'that

my Lord, no more o'that: you marre all with this starting



   Doct. Go too, go too:

You haue knowne what you should not



   Gent. She ha's spoke what shee should not, I am sure

of that: Heauen knowes what she ha's knowne



   La. Heere's the smell of the blood still: all the perfumes

of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand.

Oh, oh, oh



   Doct. What a sigh is there? The hart is sorely charg'd



   Gent. I would not haue such a heart in my bosome,

for the dignity of the whole body
