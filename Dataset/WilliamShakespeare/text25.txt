Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,

Was not like madness. There's something in his soul

O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;

And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose

Will be some danger: which for to prevent,

I have in quick determination

Thus set it down:--he shall with speed to England

For the demand of our neglected tribute:

Haply the seas, and countries different,

With variable objects, shall expel

This something-settled matter in his heart;

Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus

From fashion of himself. What think you on't?



Pol.

It shall do well: but yet do I believe

The origin and commencement of his grief

Sprung from neglected love.--How now, Ophelia!

You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said;

We heard it all.--My lord, do as you please;

But if you hold it fit, after the play,

Let his queen mother all alone entreat him

To show his grief: let her be round with him;

And I'll be plac'd, so please you, in the ear

Of all their conference. If she find him not,

To England send him; or confine him where

Your wisdom best shall think.



King.

It shall be so:

Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.

[Enter Hamlet and certain Players.]



Ham.

Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you,

trippingly on the tongue: but if you mouth it, as many of your

players do, I had as lief the town crier spoke my lines. Nor do

not saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but use all

gently: for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say,

whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget a

temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it offends me to the

soul, to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to

tatters, to very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who,

for the most part, are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb

shows and noise: I would have such a fellow whipped for o'erdoing

Termagant; it out-herods Herod: pray you avoid it.



I Player.

I warrant your honour.



Ham.

Be not too tame neither; but let your own discretion be your

tutor: suit the action to the word, the word to the action; with

this special observance, that you o'erstep not the modesty of

nature: for anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing,

whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold, as

'twere, the mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own image,

scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time his

form and pressure. Now, this overdone, or come tardy off, though

it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious

grieve; the censure of the which one must in your allowance,

o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that I

have seen play,--and heard others praise, and that highly,--not

to speak it profanely, that, neither having the accent of

Christians, nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so

strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of nature's

journeymen had made men, and not made them well, they imitated

humanity so abominably.



I Player.

I hope we have reform'd that indifferently with us, sir.



Ham.

O, reform it altogether. And let those that play your clowns

speak no more than is set down for them: for there be of them

that will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren

spectators to laugh too, though in the meantime some necessary

question of the play be then to be considered: that's villanous

and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it. Go

make you ready.



[Exeunt Players.]



[Enter Polonius, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.]



How now, my lord! will the king hear this piece of work?



Pol.

And the queen too, and that presently.



Ham.

Bid the players make haste.



[Exit Polonius.]



Will you two help to hasten them?



Ros. and Guil.

We will, my lord.



[Exeunt Ros. and Guil.]



Ham.

What, ho, Horatio!



[Enter Horatio.]



Hor.

Here, sweet lord, at your service.



Ham.

Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man

As e'er my conversation cop'd withal.



Hor.

O, my dear lord,--



Ham.

Nay, do not think I flatter;

For what advancement may I hope from thee,

That no revenue hast, but thy good spirits,

To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?

No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp;

And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee

Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?

Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice,

And could of men distinguish, her election

Hath seal'd thee for herself: for thou hast been

As one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing;

A man that Fortune's buffets and rewards

Hast ta'en with equal thanks: and bles'd are those

Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled

That they are not a pipe for Fortune's finger

To sound what stop she please. Give me that man

That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him

In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,

As I do thee.--Something too much of this.--

There is a play to-night before the king;

One scene of it comes near the circumstance,

Which I have told thee, of my father's death:

I pr'ythee, when thou see'st that act a-foot,

Even with the very comment of thy soul

Observe mine uncle: if his occulted guilt

Do not itself unkennel in one speech,

It is a damned ghost that we have seen;

And my imaginations are as foul

As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;

For I mine eyes will rivet to his face;

And, after, we will both our judgments join

In censure of his seeming.



Hor.

Well, my lord:

If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,

And scape detecting, I will pay the theft.



Ham.

They are coming to the play. I must be idle:

Get you a place.



[Danish march. A flourish. Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia,

Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and others.]



King.

How fares our cousin Hamlet?



Ham.

Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish: I eat the air,

promise-crammed: you cannot feed capons so.



King.

I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet; these words are not

mine.



Ham.

No, nor mine now. My lord, you play'd once i' the university, you

say? [To Polonius.]



Pol.

That did I, my lord, and was accounted a good actor.



Ham.

What did you enact?



Pol.

I did enact Julius Caesar; I was kill'd i' the Capitol; Brutus

killed me.



Ham.

It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there.--Be

the players ready?



Ros.

Ay, my lord; they stay upon your patience.
