Ham.

     A whole one, I.

   For thou dost know, O Damon dear,

     This realm dismantled was

   Of Jove himself; and now reigns here

     A very, very--pajock.



Hor.

You might have rhymed.



Ham.

O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a thousand

pound! Didst perceive?



Hor.

Very well, my lord.



Ham.

Upon the talk of the poisoning?--



Hor.

I did very well note him.



Ham.

Ah, ha!--Come, some music! Come, the recorders!--

   For if the king like not the comedy,

   Why then, belike he likes it not, perdy.

Come, some music!



[Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]



Guil.

Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.



Ham.

Sir, a whole history.



Guil.

The king, sir--



Ham.

Ay, sir, what of him?



Guil.

Is, in his retirement, marvellous distempered.



Ham.

With drink, sir?



Guil.

No, my lord; rather with choler.



Ham.

Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to

the doctor; for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps

plunge him into far more choler.



Guil.

Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame, and start

not so wildly from my affair.



Ham.

I am tame, sir:--pronounce.



Guil.

The queen, your mother, in most great affliction of spirit,

hath sent me to you.



Ham.

You are welcome.



Guil.

Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right breed.

If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer, I will do

your mother's commandment: if not, your pardon and my return

shall be the end of my business.



Ham.

Sir, I cannot.



Guil.

What, my lord?



Ham.

Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseased: but, sir, such

answer as I can make, you shall command; or rather, as you say,

my mother: therefore no more, but to the matter: my mother, you

say,--



Ros.

Then thus she says: your behaviour hath struck her into

amazement and admiration.



Ham.

O wonderful son, that can so stonish a mother!--But is there no

sequel at the heels of this mother's admiration?



Ros.

She desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to bed.



Ham.

We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have you any

further trade with us?



Ros.

My lord, you once did love me.



Ham.

And so I do still, by these pickers and stealers.



Ros.

Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? you do, surely,

bar the door upon your own liberty if you deny your griefs to

your friend.



Ham.

Sir, I lack advancement.



Ros.

How can that be, when you have the voice of the king himself

for your succession in Denmark?



Ham.

Ay, sir, but 'While the grass grows'--the proverb is something

musty.



[Re-enter the Players, with recorders.]



O, the recorders:--let me see one.--To withdraw with you:--why do

you go about to recover the wind of me, as if you would drive me

into a toil?



Guil.

O my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too unmannerly.



Ham.

I do not well understand that. Will you play upon this pipe?



Guil.

My lord, I cannot.



Ham.

I pray you.



Guil.

Believe me, I cannot.



Ham.

I do beseech you.



Guil.

I know, no touch of it, my lord.



Ham.

'Tis as easy as lying: govern these ventages with your

finger and thumb, give it breath with your mouth, and it will

discourse most eloquent music. Look you, these are the stops.



Guil.

But these cannot I command to any utterance of harmony; I

have not the skill.



Ham.

Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me! You

would play upon me; you would seem to know my stops; you would

pluck out the heart of my mystery; you would sound me from my

lowest note to the top of my compass; and there is much music,

excellent voice, in this little organ, yet cannot you make it

speak. 'Sblood, do you think I am easier to be played on than a

pipe? Call me what instrument you will, though you can fret me,

you cannot play upon me.



[Enter Polonius.]



God bless you, sir!



Pol.

My lord, the queen would speak with you, and presently.



Ham.

Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?



Pol.

By the mass, and 'tis like a camel indeed.



Ham.

Methinks it is like a weasel.



Pol.

It is backed like a weasel.



Ham.

Or like a whale.



Pol.

Very like a whale.



Ham.

Then will I come to my mother by and by.--They fool me to the

top of my bent.--I will come by and by.



Pol.

I will say so.



[Exit.]



Ham.

By-and-by is easily said.



[Exit Polonius.]



--Leave me, friends.

King.

I like him not; nor stands it safe with us

To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you;

I your commission will forthwith dispatch,

And he to England shall along with you:

The terms of our estate may not endure

Hazard so near us as doth hourly grow

Out of his lunacies.



Guil.

We will ourselves provide:

Most holy and religious fear it is

To keep those many many bodies safe

That live and feed upon your majesty.



Ros.

The single and peculiar life is bound,

With all the strength and armour of the mind,

To keep itself from 'noyance; but much more

That spirit upon whose weal depend and rest

The lives of many. The cease of majesty

Dies not alone; but like a gulf doth draw

What's near it with it: it is a massy wheel,

Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,

To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things

Are mortis'd and adjoin'd; which, when it falls,

Each small annexment, petty consequence,

Attends the boisterous ruin. Never alone

Did the king sigh, but with a general groan.



King.

Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage;

For we will fetters put upon this fear,

Which now goes too free-footed.



Ros and Guil.

We will haste us.
