  Doct. Well, well, well



   Gent. Pray God it be sir



   Doct. This disease is beyond my practise: yet I haue

knowne those which haue walkt in their sleep, who haue

dyed holily in their beds



   Lad. Wash your hands, put on your Night-Gowne,

looke not so pale: I tell you yet againe Banquo's buried;

he cannot come out on's graue



   Doct. Euen so?

  Lady. To bed, to bed: there's knocking at the gate:

Come, come, come, come, giue me your hand: What's

done, cannot be vndone. To bed, to bed, to bed.



Exit Lady.



  Doct. Will she go now to bed?

  Gent. Directly



   Doct. Foule whisp'rings are abroad: vnnaturall deeds

Do breed vnnaturall troubles: infected mindes

To their deafe pillowes will discharge their Secrets:

More needs she the Diuine, then the Physitian:

God, God forgiue vs all. Looke after her,

Remoue from her the meanes of all annoyance,

And still keepe eyes vpon her: So goodnight,

My minde she ha's mated, and amaz'd my sight.

I thinke, but dare not speake



   Gent. Good night good Doctor.



Exeunt.





Scena Secunda.



Drum and Colours. Enter Menteth, Cathnes, Angus, Lenox,

Soldiers.



  Ment. The English powre is neere, led on by Malcolm,

His Vnkle Seyward, and the good Macduff.

Reuenges burne in them: for their deere causes

Would to the bleeding, and the grim Alarme

Excite the mortified man



   Ang. Neere Byrnan wood

Shall we well meet them, that way are they comming



   Cath. Who knowes if Donalbane be with his brother?

  Len. For certaine Sir, he is not: I haue a File

Of all the Gentry; there is Seywards Sonne,

And many vnruffe youths, that euen now

Protest their first of Manhood



   Ment. What do's the Tyrant



   Cath. Great Dunsinane he strongly Fortifies:

Some say hee's mad: Others, that lesser hate him,

Do call it valiant Fury, but for certaine

He cannot buckle his distemper'd cause

Within the belt of Rule



   Ang. Now do's he feele

His secret Murthers sticking on his hands,

Now minutely Reuolts vpbraid his Faith-breach:

Those he commands, moue onely in command,

Nothing in loue: Now do's he feele his Title

Hang loose about him, like a Giants Robe

Vpon a dwarfish Theefe



   Ment. Who then shall blame

His pester'd Senses to recoyle, and start,

When all that is within him, do's condemne

It selfe, for being there



   Cath. Well, march we on,

To giue Obedience, where 'tis truly ow'd:

Meet we the Med'cine of the sickly Weale,

And with him poure we in our Countries purge,

Each drop of vs



   Lenox. Or so much as it needes,

To dew the Soueraigne Flower, and drowne the Weeds:

Make we our March towards Birnan.



Exeunt. marching.





Scaena Tertia.



Enter Macbeth, Doctor, and Attendants.



  Macb. Bring me no more Reports, let them flye all:

Till Byrnane wood remoue to Dunsinane,

I cannot taint with Feare. What's the Boy Malcolme?

Was he not borne of woman? The Spirits that know

All mortall Consequences, haue pronounc'd me thus:

Feare not Macbeth, no man that's borne of woman

Shall ere haue power vpon thee. Then fly false Thanes,

And mingle with the English Epicures,

The minde I sway by, and the heart I beare,

Shall neuer sagge with doubt, nor shake with feare.

Enter Seruant.



The diuell damne thee blacke, thou cream-fac'd Loone:

Where got'st thou that Goose-looke



   Ser. There is ten thousand



   Macb. Geese Villaine?

  Ser. Souldiers Sir



   Macb. Go pricke thy face, and ouer-red thy feare

Thou Lilly-liuer'd Boy. What Soldiers, Patch?

Death of thy Soule, those Linnen cheekes of thine

Are Counsailers to feare. What Soldiers Whay-face?

  Ser. The English Force, so please you



   Macb. Take thy face hence. Seyton, I am sick at hart,

When I behold: Seyton, I say, this push

Will cheere me euer, or dis-eate me now.

I haue liu'd long enough: my way of life

Is falne into the Seare, the yellow Leafe,

And that which should accompany Old-Age,

As Honor, Loue, Obedience, Troopes of Friends,

I must not looke to haue: but in their steed,

Curses, not lowd but deepe, Mouth-honor, breath

Which the poore heart would faine deny, and dare not.

Seyton?

Enter Seyton.



  Sey. What's your gracious pleasure?

  Macb. What Newes more?

  Sey. All is confirm'd my Lord, which was reported



   Macb. Ile fight, till from my bones, my flesh be hackt.

Giue me my Armor



   Seyt. 'Tis not needed yet



   Macb. Ile put it on:

Send out moe Horses, skirre the Country round,

Hang those that talke of Feare. Giue me mine Armor:

How do's your Patient, Doctor?

  Doct. Not so sicke my Lord,

As she is troubled with thicke-comming Fancies

That keepe her from her rest



   Macb. Cure of that:

Can'st thou not Minister to a minde diseas'd,

Plucke from the Memory a rooted Sorrow,

Raze out the written troubles of the Braine,

And with some sweet Obliuious Antidote

Cleanse the stufft bosome, of that perillous stuffe

Which weighes vpon the heart?

  Doct. Therein the Patient

Must minister to himselfe



   Macb. Throw Physicke to the Dogs, Ile none of it.

Come, put mine Armour on: giue me my Staffe:

Seyton, send out: Doctor, the Thanes flye from me:

Come sir, dispatch. If thou could'st Doctor, cast

The Water of my Land, finde her Disease,

And purge it to a sound and pristine Health,

I would applaud thee to the very Eccho,

That should applaud againe. Pull't off I say,

What Rubarb, Cyme, or what Purgatiue drugge

Would scowre these English hence: hear'st y of them?

  Doct. I my good Lord: your Royall Preparation

Makes vs heare something



   Macb. Bring it after me:

I will not be affraid of Death and Bane,

Till Birnane Forrest come to Dunsinane



   Doct. Were I from Dunsinane away, and cleere,

Profit againe should hardly draw me heere.



Exeunt.



Scena Quarta.



Drum and Colours. Enter Malcolme, Seyward, Macduffe,

Seywards Sonne,

Menteth, Cathnes, Angus, and Soldiers Marching.



  Malc. Cosins, I hope the dayes are neere at hand

That Chambers will be safe



   Ment. We doubt it nothing



   Seyw. What wood is this before vs?

  Ment. The wood of Birnane



   Malc. Let euery Souldier hew him downe a Bough,

And bear't before him, thereby shall we shadow

The numbers of our Hoast, and make discouery

Erre in report of vs



   Sold. It shall be done



   Syw. We learne no other, but the confident Tyrant

Keepes still in Dunsinane, and will indure

Our setting downe befor't



   Malc. 'Tis his maine hope:

For where there is aduantage to be giuen,

Both more and lesse haue giuen him the Reuolt,

And none serue with him, but constrained things,

Whose hearts are absent too



   Macd. Let our iust Censures

Attend the true euent, and put we on

Industrious Souldiership



   Sey. The time approaches,

That will with due decision make vs know

What we shall say we haue, and what we owe:

Thoughts speculatiue, their vnsure hopes relate,

But certaine issue, stroakes must arbitrate,

Towards which, aduance the warre.



Exeunt. marching



Scena Quinta.



Enter Macbeth, Seyton, & Souldiers, with Drum and Colours.



  Macb. Hang out our Banners on the outward walls,

The Cry is still, they come: our Castles strength

Will laugh a Siedge to scorne: Heere let them lye,

Till Famine and the Ague eate them vp:

Were they not forc'd with those that should be ours,

We might haue met them darefull, beard to beard,

And beate them backward home. What is that noyse?



A Cry within of Women.



  Sey. It is the cry of women, my good Lord



   Macb. I haue almost forgot the taste of Feares:

The time ha's beene, my sences would haue cool'd

To heare a Night-shrieke, and my Fell of haire

Would at a dismall Treatise rowze, and stirre

As life were in't. I haue supt full with horrors,

Direnesse familiar to my slaughterous thoughts

Cannot once start me. Wherefore was that cry?

  Sey. The Queene (my Lord) is dead
